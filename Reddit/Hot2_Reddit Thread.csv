Are you helping anyone with video takedown-related issues at the moment? Because if that's in your ballpark there's a whole bunch of channels that could do with your advice.

Here's one for starters - there's been a couple of channels that received strikes on their videos for use of copyrighted material causing loss of revenue etc through false claims as the videos are very obviously fair use. The person who reported that video then publicly admitted to making a false claim out of spite or to teach the content creator 'a lesson'.

On that basis does the content creator at least have the grounds to have a lawyer contact that person or at most make a counter-claim for loss of revenue etc?"

Because you really can't. DMCA takedowns are fundamentally flawed. Anyone, for any reason, with little or no proof can order a take down and the site is required by law to follow through with it as soon as they're made aware. If the claim ends up being false, there's no recourse for the victim. You *might* be able to sue the person but it would be an uphill battle that may end up costing more than it's worth in both time and money."

A key thing about trade skills is that some of them aren't going anywhere. No matter what happens in the world people are going to shit and need electricity to keep their homes comfortable so they can keep shitting. See where I'm going with this? A lot of times we're distanced from what the basics are in our society because they are so common place and work so well. The key thing though is when they don't work well, someone's getting paid good money to deal with it. 

This is where tradeskills come in. I used the Department of Labor website to try to narrow down some fields I was interested in. I might be a bit of a misnomer, but I enjoyed working with my hands and being sore at the end of the day, but I also want to be intellectually engaged in what I'm doing. This is why I'm seeking out a tradeskill path and wasn't too picky about what I chose. 

Also, you asked about ""what type of trade schools"".  Community colleges that are situated around industry heavy areas tend to have a program set up with major players in that industry so that the college can train new hires into the industry and therefore streamline the process of getting new, competent help onboard. 

It all depends on where you live, is what it boils down to.

Typically right to work states where dues are not mandatory to benefit from union bargaining, unions are often weak. Each state that has right to work laws can operate differently and therefore have a different effect on the local union. Also not all unions are equal from trade to trade. Some are strong some are not. I recommend a pipe trades Union, electricians Union or if you can get in, elevator installers Union. Thee good pipe trades schools are typically Union affiliated."

In the Amanda Todd one, after they finished watching it, one girl was just crying there and they just kept filming her and even included those parts, just to show how sad she was.

Monetising sensative content for a profit is more of a grey area. On one hand, obviously people watch and enjoy the content, so why not?

No, they are using React World to capture ALL react videos. They are already using their lawyers to bully others who make react videos. Here are some common responses defending the Fine Bros and why they are incorrect:**

----

**The Fine Bros are just branding their specific react videos, not all reaction videos**

1.	They have already legally trademarked Kids React, Teens React, and Elders React. They have been using their lawyers to threaten other channels who are attempting to make videos of kids react videos for years.
2.	Once React World launches, react videos of any demographic that falls under their media empire are their trademark. You can currently make “engineers react”, or “nurses react”, but once the Fine Bros successfully trademark all of these reaction types, they can use their lawyers to threaten you just like they currently threaten you for making kids react videos.
3.	They feel so entitled to their “format” that they think anything remotely similar to one of their “formats” is infringing on their intellectual property. They even threatened ELLEN for stealing their “format”. Ellen’s video is nothing like anything the Fine Bros do, she’s just showing kids on her show some old technology: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CMS9xnBRkc They made a facebook post calling Ellen thieves and bullies stealing and not respecting the Fine Bros. They’ve deleted that post but their tweet still exists (please screen cap it before they delete this too): https://twitter.com/thefinebros/status/513061415016341504
4.	In summary, the Fine Bros have always felt entitled to their unoriginal and stolen format. They say they won’t go after other content creators but they have been using their lawyers to shut down other content creators for years. They feel so entitled that they even considered that Ellen segment an infringement on their “format”. 

This should give you a VERY clear idea of what kind of people and what kind of motive the Fine Bros have.

**These guys are just licensing their shows to others, what’s the big deal?**

1.	That is their PR talk. Let’s look at their actions. They’ve used their leverage with Youtube to take down channels that were making kids react videos and seniors react videos. They’ve even threatened Ellen on Facebook and tried to use their fans to brigade Ellen for daring to produce this segment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CMS9xnBRkc

**They are just talking about their specific format, brand, etc. Not a big deal**

1.	They trademark every aspect of their “format” which already overlaps with what other reaction videos are. 

2. Once they use their fans to expand their trademark into every type of react video under the sun, then they can use their legal leverage to push you out. 

----

**The Fine Bros’ Strategy to trademark ALL react videos**

1.	Make no mistake about it, the Fine Bros fully intend on making ALL react videos theirs. And React World is how they will do it. The Fine Bros already trademarked kids react, teens react, elders react, etc. You cannot make a video of kids reacting to redbull and call it “kids react to Redbull”. Don’t believe me? Here are the Fine Bros’ own words: http://imgur.com/oik8CsA
2.	So how does this lead to them trademarking ALL react videos? Well once React World goes online, and people of all demographics make react videos and put them under Fine Bros’ empire, they will then trademark all of those new react titles the same way they did with Kids React. In other words, you can make “Nurses React” right now because they haven’t trademarked it, but once Nurses React becomes part of their empire through React World, they can then trademark it and stick their lawyers on you threatening you with legal action unless you take your videos down. THIS is how they intend on taking over ALL reaction videos. It’s underhanded, manipulative, and has enough steps in between for them the have hidden this in plain sight.
3.	If you still don’t believe this, then try making a kids react video right now and call it “kids react to ___”. YOU CAN’T. The Fine Bros have used their lawyers to threaten people who have done this already and they’ll do it to you. Do not believe them when they say they won’t prevent other people from making other “types” of reaction videos. They will only allow you to make your videos until they trademark your video’s name. They will do that through React World because they don’t need to put in any effort into actually making content anymore.

**What is The Fine Bros Afraid of?**

The Fine Bros' office employs over 40 people and have HUGE overheads. Beyond losing a few subscribers, what the Fine Bros are afraid of the most right now is **losing their sponsors**. They get very little money from Youtube ads compared to their sponsors. Here's them talking about their sponsors two years ago:

>The company has created branded content for Universal Studios’ “A Million Ways to Die in the West,” AMC’s “Halt and Catch Fire,” Friskies cat food and Audible. “We have a series that is something brands can be organically integrated into,” Benny said.

>The Fine Bros. are affiliated with YouTube multichannel network Fullscreen. They are repped by WME and managed by Max Benator.

http://variety.com/2014/digital/news/youtubes-fine-bros-launch-react-channel-1201266727/

They recently did a brand deal with Disney for Star Wars too.

They've taken on so many employees and have so much overhead cost that losing even a single sponsor means they are going to have to have **layoffs**. According to several former employees and a current employee working in their office (posting in previous threads), there is serious concern about potential layoffs coming because sponsors are worried about being associated with all the negativity.

So the Fine Bros have a lot on their hands. There will be lawsuits coming to challenge their ridiculous trademark on ""React"". There will be a lot of pissed off people flooding their sponsors' social media pages that may cost them sponsors. And they are dealing with serious office morale loss because of how tainted their ""brand"" is. The Fine Bros built their business on internet culture, they should have really known better than to think they could get away with this.

**The Fine Bros are potentially going to lose their new TV show ""Six Degrees of Everything"" on TruTV**

The Fine Bros currently has an ongoing TV show on TruTV that just completed its first season last year: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4566242/

The Fine Bros wants to ""[grow into a big media company](http://variety.com/2014/digital/news/youtubes-fine-bros-launch-react-channel-1201266727/)"". This is why the Fine Bros had their entire staff monitor social media sites to scrub your comments. They deleted thousands of comments and are still heavily censoring their Facebook comments so that any hard questions or criticisms of their trademark attempt do not show up. They do not want TruTV to find out. But now that people are starting to go to TruTV (and its parent company), they apparently gave up on hardcore censorship of their Youtube comments.

**Edit: Thanks to /u/bboyjkang we've dug up The Fine Bros' deleted facebook post that called on their fans to brigade Ellen's show for doing a segment that had nothing to do with their Kids React format. Need anymore proof of their entitled attitude, their anti-competitive aggression, and their REAL motives for trademarking ""react""?**

Once something goes on the internet, it's there forever Fine Bros. You don't own the format of talking to kids, as much as you may want to: http://imgur.com/idasVMZ

**Mounting evidence of them abusing DMCA takedowns to shut down smaller react channels**

A channel that made seniors react videos was shut down by the Fine Bros a few weeks before the Fine Bros launched ""Elders React"":

Ocubox just retwteeted this: https://twitter.com/TheWhang/status/692928629265821696

Ocubox was a channel that was making ""British Kids React"" videos that was abused by the Fine Bros DCMA harassment and forced to stop making ""British Kids React"" videos. The Fine Bros STILL want to lie to us and claim they aren't using their ""trademark"" to go after EVERYBODY. Doesn't matter if you are small (Ocubox, seniors react) or big (Ellen), The Fine Bros feels entitled to your stuff.

A trademark is a much wider protection, and would allow them to go after people using the format. As to whether they will or not, we don't know, but we know from the past that even without this legal protection they have gone after people.

It's an issue that they can use the trademark to defend it, even though even the most orange defenders of the fine bro'shave admitted that they did not invent the format, and it would be stupid evil to lock other people out of the format. 

It's like this, there are two late-night shows, the Tonight Show and Late-Night. The tonight show cannot use the late nights graphics or set, but it can use a similar set and similar graphics. But, if the late-night trademarked the format, the Tonight Show could not use anything similar. and that will be wrong, because it would be trademarking the idea of talking to celebrities on a couch with a host behind a desk on TV."

Reaction videos are incredibly generic and simple. The simplicity of these videos means production is easy to replicate (take stimulus add a viewer and record results) so much so that many have started to make this type of content (often with less production value). Essentially this has kind of saturated the market with various “reaction” videos from that douche Jinx to Korean’s react, ect. I mean think about it, you can make a video of anything reacts to something (reactions are a law of nature ffs) and it would be virtually impossible for the Fine brothers to cover all the “reaction” combinations out there. 

   
Now, add into this equation the Fine Brothers themselves, who seem to believe that they have discovered the YouTube equivalent of Insulin. However, unlike the great Dr. Frederick Banting these fucks want sole proprietorship of the incredibly vague concept of reaction videos. Why? Eh, they’re dicks. I mean fuckin come on man, you can’t make every different reaction video out there, there’s just too many different combinations – swedes react to Korean food, dogs react to trampolines, you see what I mean? So other channels have filled in what the Fine Brothers have missed and they pissed about the potential revenue they could have made. Additionally I also think they truly believe they have an original concept, like documenting reactions is an entirely new concept. WTF. So they feel self-entitled to the revenue and exposure these other channels get.
 
Now, here is where the genius (or malevolence) of “React World” comes in. Not only will licensing for their “format” garnish them a decent paycheck, but it will essentially saturate the market with Fine Brothers brand, weakening the competition and possibly influencing YouTube search algorithms to favor their content. Each search of the keyword “react” would heavily favor their brand (more so in local searches), they could cover a wide range of the different “react” combinations through their licenses subsidiaries, and they would provide the support and production assets to further bury any competition. Essentially this could eliminate any innovation (if that was possible with this type of garbage) as licensees would have to follow their format, use their assets and strangle those who might take a different approach to the genre. 
I hate these vids, just my opinion, but the precedence this sets is terrifying. How many other large YouTube channels will follow this format if it becomes a success? Pewdiepie license anyone?

You use their 'brand' and they'll take 80% revenue, give you 20% and a pat on the head. This is how franchising works with McDonald's or KFC. Except it's on the Internet.

The backlash is simply because of how vague their terminology is, and how 'reaction videos' are a staple of the Internet (e.g. The 2 girls 1 cup reaction videos, from back-in-the-day).

If they successfully trademark a few series, then it adds leverage if someone else does a popular reaction video and they see the potential of another lucrative brand.

BuzzFeed have their own reaction series, which is fine as it nearly always says: 'Buzzfeed video' in the title. But what The Fine Bros are starting here is a bold, and foreboding, foray into Trademarks and its applicable strength to the online world.

Apple should have every right to take legal action against that store (if and when they find out about it). In fact, Apple has an obligation to send a notice of infringement (e.g. in the form of a cease and desist letter) to that store if they want to keep the Apple trademark protected.

If those companies came into the scene after Apple did, then initially Apple would have the complete right to go after them and shut them down. In fact, they have an obligation to do just that if they want to keep the trademark protected.

However, if many companies start freely using the ""apple"" trademark and Apple doesn't do anything about, Apple will eventually lose trademark protection and a court will no longer rule in their favor.

At this point, the trademark ""apple"" would become generic and lose all protections such that it may be used by anyone within the computers/electronics industry without any problems.

This is what happened in the past with trademarks like: aspirin, escalator, flip phone, kerosene, laundromat, linoleum, thermos, trampoline, videotape, etc. Some other generic trademarks have also lost protection for different reasons like: app, touch-tone, zip code, zipper, etc.

Companies like Adobe have been concerned in the past about the genericization of their product names and how this could potentially cause them to lose trademark protection. Adobe, for example, put out a statement that they want people to stop using ""photoshop"" as a verb/adjective to mean edited/manipulated because it was hurting their brand/trademark. So they wanted to stop people from saying things like ""It looks photoshopped"" or ""Did you photoshop this picture?"" when they just meant edited/manipulated.

Anyway, the concern is that if TheFineBros are awarded the ""react"" trademark, they will have an obligation to take action against anyone using the title ""react"" within the context of internet video episodes where groups of people react to things, otherwise they will lose the trademark protections."

""Prior-art"" is a patent law term, but the same sort of principle applies to trademarks. You can't just show up and suddenly claim the trademark for a term in an industry where that term was already being used by other companies before you.

The problem is that in order to invalidate TheFineBros' ""react"" trademark application, you would specifically need to find prior examples where people filmed/produced internet video episodes with ""react"" in the title that involved having multiple people react to and answer questions about something.

That's essentially what the trademark claim covers. They're basically saying they were the first people to create an online ""react"" video series where a group of people (e.g. ""kids"") give their reactions to videos/things and answer questions about them.

So in order to invalidate the trademark, you would have to find concrete examples where some other person/studio did similar online ""react"" videos with groups of people before the TheFineBros.

Edit: either that, or you have to be able to show that there are so many other people/studios that have ""react"" video series like theirs that the term ""react"" can not be protected. However, since there is evidence that TheFineBros have repeatedly shutdown and filed copyright claims against any ""react"" videos that have a similar premise, it seems that it may actually be difficult to argue that similar ""react"" series by other people/studios already exist."

Sometimes, the first person to do or say or coin a phrase claims the trademark. But very often, the person who popularized a thing can be awarded the trademark. This would be the case with the Fine Bros. They didn't invent React videos, but if they popularized them and are heavily associated with them, and no else protests, then they can get the trademark. This is the same thing that happened with the woman, whose name escapes me, who has owned the trademark for ""shabby chic"" for decades. She trademarked the term long before it was a popular trend, even though it was a common enough phrase for the style, and at the time it was heavily associated with her brand as an interior decorator.

I am not a trademark lawyer, but if I had to hazard a guess I would say the issue the Fine Bros face is that although React videos are largely associated with their brand, and although a lot of other videos follow a similar structure, they didn't try to get the trademark before it was a trend and before a million other people were already doing the same thing. And have been for years. There are other YouTube channels with well established reaction videos series, following the same format, and who have lots of views.

This is not correct. What would they be liable for, that someone is infringing on their trademark?

Edit: I guess with liability, you're talking about DMCA takedowns? As in YouTube taking down other people's content, when they get a request. That's an agreement between YouTube and content providers.

You can always host the content yourself, ignore the DMCA takedown request and battle it out in court. Google just don't want to do that, so they remove your content, tell you to go fuck yourself, and are free of all liability by doing so. They don't need to host your content.

It's a bit more nuanced than that. Sure it was inspired by the work Xerox did (and Xerox certainly wasn't the only one working on a GUI) but Apple made massive changes and improvements. What they eventually released was very different. For example, Xerox's GUI had windows, but they didn't have the concept of *overlapping* windows, which is a significant part of what makes it useful. It had no drag-and-drop file manipulation, it had no pull-down menu's, no icons , no clipboard, etc. Hell, it didn't even repaint it's windows until you clicked on them. "

~~As for context menus, almost every single window in Xerox Star had a conext menu icon (one of the first ever uses of the now ubiquitous ""hamburger"" icon) which opened up a contextual menu.

Sure. But the Xerox Star was not the machine that Jobs saw, the Star is a later development. Jobs was shown the Alto and D-machines. Also, I wasn't talking about context menus but pull-down menus. 

>Also, cut copy and paste functionality was present, 

In the star, not in the Alto. The Star was released 8 years after the Alto.

I totally understand where you're coming from with the misinformation thing, too, I'm similar, however my point about derailing the other comment with specifics when as a general point it was true. Regardless of how much of the Xerox GUI they took inspiration from they still did, and Jobs himself even mentions that he was suprised when he saw the GUI systems when being shown around at Xerox and the way he describes the encounter and his reaction to it suggests it was a change of mindset for him, how he had his software engineers study the system.

Pull down menus are the menu's at the top of your screen (File/Edit/...) that you pull down. Context menu's are a later invention; it's the right-click menu that shows actions that are relevant in the context of the thing you clicked on.

That's exactly what he did. And that is exactly what they didn't do in the slide-to-unlock case. It was exactly as you said a change in mindset, a new way of doing things; eyes were opened. He then took these new insights and designed a computer around those ideas, often evolving them, taking them to their logical next step. 

With the slide-to-unlock there was no new insight, they didn't go 'wow, I never imagined you could do that', they didn't take a new idea and apply it to their product. They just copied a feature from the iPhone because they were trying to make a cheap knockoff. "

I had to shut down my entire business to avoid going to court. The trademark owner will come in and make a bunch of claims ""you are violating our trademark and deriving monetary gain from it, therefore we have a claim to those profits"" etc. Then they pretty strong arm you into doing whatever they say to avoid the lawsuit. They can even make bogus claims against you and have the most shittiest of evidence and they can still drag you into court. It is a nightmare. 

The reason I had to shut down my business was because the cost of litigation is so expensive. My company was a tiny startup that had most of our capital invested in R&D (creating the product, basically). When we finally launched, sales were growing steadily and that is when this organization showed up with their claims against us. We were their competitor so they pretty much used the courts to get rid of their competition. Pretty outrageous.

So what does this mean for you tiny YouTube content creators? It means you will be extorted constantly with lawsuits. You will have absolutely no way to fight them, unless you have deep pockets. The amount of money you are making from youtube ads is next to nothing compared to the cost of litigation.

Actually, they kind of aren't. Unless YouTube has changed something, they're a safe harbor. With DMCA, the copyright holder tells safe harbor site that the content is theirs and needs to be removed. The site then follows DMCA procedure and removes the content. They make no determination over the validity of the claim, because they can be held accountable if they do. The poster who had their stuff removed can then choose to file a counter notice, or not. Once a counter notice is filed, the original filer can then choose to escalate the dispute to legal action, or not. At this stage, either party can be held financially responsible for how shit went down, and that shit is often expensive and drawn out, so it's important than neither party file unless they're serious. YouTube, like all DMCA safe harbors, wipes their hands as clean as possible and tells people to sort that shit out themselves.

A cursory Google shows that the term ""reaction video"" was coined years before they attempted to trademark these sort of things. If they submitted documents to the USPTO with wording from these previous writings on ""reaction videos"" would that somehow be an infringement of copyright law?"
1330,czha6ew,t3_43bqa1,t1_czh82nl,1454129973.0,Frelling_Dren,1,0,0,0,1,"Not OP and not a lawyer.  I am, however, a legal assistant specializing in trademark application/opposition, copyright, and general IP/IT litigation.  Obligatory: none of this response is meant/nor should be taken as legal advice.  Also, because IANAL, you should know that some of the below could easily be wrong, and I will be happy to be corrected by someone more knowledgeable than me.

The short answer, as with most legal questions, is ""possibly.""  The longer answer is ""almost definitely not.""  Common usage tends to negate any claim on copyright -- even common law claims, as this would most likely be -- and the word ""react"" would almost certainly be too generic to waste the money on an infringement suit due to the strict limitations on potential damage awards and very low chance of winning the suit.

The only way to get any financial remuneration (if your case made it past the initial ""yes, there is an infringement here"" phase, which, again, it probably wouldn't) would be to show that the Fine Bros.' use of the phrase ""react"" caused financial harm to your business.  Whether that stems from what is called ""likelihood of confusion"" or outright theft or otherwise, the penalties are relatively small.  Think 4-5 digits instead of 7-8.  If you can't prove financial harm, the best outcome would be that they must relinquish use of the copyright (and again, this is a trademark matter, not a copyright matter, so they are two different things).

In other words, even if you won the suit, which you almost certainly would not, there's still a very good possibility that your legal fees would outweigh the financial award, and there is never a guarantee that the court will award you your attorney fees in addition (although they can and do in many circumstances).

Your best bet with all of this is to do what /u/videogameattorney suggests and file opposition papers once the mark has published in the Gazette.  Certainly, your suggestion of screenshotting Google searches is a great one.  I've done that many times in successful Office Action responses.

Remember, the goal here is to show that the Mark is generic (you might also be able to argue that ""React"" is a ""short phrase,"" something prohibited under the Lanham Act, but I think that's a stretch), so the more evidence you can show as far back as you can go, the better.

And since I'm on a roll here apparently, what the Fine Bros. did that --  to me at least -- is shockingly stupid for a number of reasons (not the least of which is the devastating blow to any goodwill they may have had) is that they didn't file multiple applications for ""Kids React,"" ""Grandparents React,"" etc.  Those would be more difficult to oppose since there's a clear case to be made that those phrases are closely associated with their videos, at least in this particular class, and would be more difficult to successfully oppose.  My guess is they didn't want to pay for a bunch of applications at $375 a pop plus legal fees, so they went with a blanket or flagship mark and pissed off the internet.

TL;DR (and I don't blame you): No. (probably)"

Like it or not, the REACT channel on YouTube *is* Fine Bros Entertainment's. The shows on the REACT channel are original formats created by FBE. The graphical elements and specifics to their ""React To"" shows are also original, trademarkable and copyrightable content.

Basically, you can create a car like a Ford or Chevy, but you can't make it just like a Ford or Chevy. You can create a show like Kids React or Teens React or even Lyric Breakdown, but you can't create one just like it. Even in TV that wouldn't fly.

The Voice exists because it's similar, but different than American Idol. If it were the same as American Idol, as in, followed the format, graphical designs, set designs, etc, to the letter of how American Idol did, then The Voice wouldn't have survived one episode."

We also know that they are either lying or delusional when it comes to those tweets since they have gone after Ellen, Buzzfeed and other smaller channels that they claim is ""copying"" their format."

And yeah, talk shows have ripped off from YouTubers a lot...like Fallon's Whisper Challenge? That was created by a YouTuber.

I don't know of the smaller channels, but I know Buzzfeed often is criticized for being unoriginal anyway, so I wouldn't be surprised if FBE had a legitimate case against them."

1) Trademarking is not the same as patenting. They do not claim to have invented the word ""react"". 

2) They're not trademarking the word. That's impossible. 

What they're trying to trademark is the ""___ reacts to ___"" show — They're *not* trying to trademark the sentence, and they're *not* trying to trademark reaction videos.

The difference being that they want to be covered if someone is trying to make a show that too closely resembles this series. This is the whole point. 

One example is that if someone makes a video called ""Grandma reacts to GTA V"" then there's no issue with it. The problem arise if someone is deliberately trying to plagiat the show and its likeness, and possibly trying to fool people into believing it's the other show while cashing in ad money.

Same with Apple: they haven't trademarked the word or the fruit. (And they didn't patent an apple either...) What they did was to protect the company likeness and the name they took for themselves.

This is something you should do with all your products. It's a big part of starting a business. It's legitimate, and encouraged. It would be insanely stupid not to, if you believe in your product.

----

Now my personal opinion is that this *shouldn't* be protected by a trademark; it should be declined. It's too weak and I fear it will open for bullying. (Unlike other comments here I don't see registering a trademark as bullying per se, but it will definitely open for such in time)

However since redditors can't get anything but their pitchforks straight I'm just going to stay away from this pathetic kneejerk reaction and watch this from a distance.

I don't think you really understand how trademark laws work. Anyone can trademark any word but it is only if in a specific context. In the Apple example, the context is computer and other technology. The Fine Bros though trying to trademark ""react"" is really scary since the context is vague.

I ask from a position of ignorance and more than likely a misunderstanding of what being awarded trademark would mean - I'm under the impression that the legal holders of a trademark would have more power in the above situation and may be able to force a stop to the continuation of an pre-existing show/series which TFB hypothetical show apes.


I would imagine the original creators would be able to go to court, but that sounds like a David Vs Goliath scenario in legal terms given TFB would more than likely have vastly superior resources to fight a case with."

Generally speaking when you start a business you should take care to defend your mark of trade, and to keep that trademark you have to actively defend it. If you made an iPhone and Apple didn't defend its trademark in a court they would probably lose it. The court doesn't do any work for you that way. 

In this case TFB has done two things that every serious business does on a regular basis: 1) they've trademarked their product, and 2) they defend it (like going against The Ellen Show etc). 

""Trademark rights may be used to prevent others from using a confusingly similar mark, but not to prevent others from making the same goods or from selling the same goods or services under a clearly different mark.""

The problem is that they were actually granted that trademark, and so they have support in what many, and I, think are weak cases. They're not evil or eat puppies for breakfast; the trademark office should never have granted them this TM in the first place.

Well, they're sure as hell trying. The application is for the word ""React"" as related to a video observing and/or interviewing individuals. That would pretty much make every other reaction video that uses the word ""react"" in the title infringing.

If they wanted to protect their existing show brands, their other trademark applications cover that - they have separate applications for ""kids react"", ""elders react"", ""adults react"", etc.  What they're doing with their application for the word ""react"" alone is to lock out anyone else from creating a new series they haven't thought of first.

> Well, they're sure as hell trying. The application is for the word ""React"" as related to a video observing and/or interviewing individuals.

I sincerely hope people don't think they're getting the full details of what the trademark actually registers from the listing at USPTO. [According to this](http://www.uspto.gov/trademark/guides-and-manuals/trademark-identification-goods-and-services-manual-suggestions), there's a 25 word limit on what you can submit in that field. 

What have they actually trademarked? I'm not sure. Unless they have significantly more information about the trademark than a necessarily truncated USPTO listing, neither is anyone else in this thread. I have my suspicions, but I don't know enough about trademark law to be sure. Guess I'll wait and see what the actual trademark lawyer says.

Actually, that's pretty much it, all the details regarding a trademark's registration are publicly available online and easily accessible. I'm not a trademark attorney (yet) but I'm in Law School and have clerked for a couple of IP firms. Also, your link is for suggesting valid generalized descriptions into the database of  G&S suggestions, not for actual trademark applications which are short, but have no word limit as far as I know. 

The trademark process is designed to be as transparent as possible to avoid costly errors. Anyone can do a free TESS lookup to find out if a certain word is trademarked or how many trademarks a specific company owns. [Here I'm pulling all live marks claimed by the fine brothers.](http://i.imgur.com/u8cfV9y.png) 

For each trademark, you can access [all relevant correspondence between the claimant and the USPTO](http://i.imgur.com/k0ly1Ll.png). If the USPTO believes the Goods & Services description is unclear, or too broad, it will appear here. In the case for the react mark, the examiner [originally denied the fine bros. description](http://i.imgur.com/UUNITjh.png) until it was clarified to the current iteration. 

The reason why Examiners are such sticklers is because descriptions are the boundaries to trademarks. The trademark owner can only enforce his trademark against those who use the mark in businesses similar to the one described in the Goods and Services description of the trademark.

Maybe both sides need to refocus and take some time and rethink the issue (maybe there were some overstatements) (that is, both the people concerned about the Fine Bros. idea and the Fine Bros.):

I watched the Fine Bros announcement. I don't know, if you want to make a video that purposely imitates style, graphics, timing, and tone, it's great that this small company is OK with you doing that, and will encourage it, as long as they get money from using their show.

If one wants to make one's own react videos in a style and pacing that one likes, that is not imitative, that does not seem to be affected by this. There is a big difference between making a video in a genre and making a video that tries to copy another video's style. Fine Bros.' React videos certainly have a particular directorial and aesthetic style.

If the Fine Bros. are sending out Cease and Desist letters to react videos that are not similar to the Fine Bros. videos, then that's a problem. That needs documentation.

But preventing people from copying you (and preventing big companies from using your idea to make a bigger-production-of-your-idea production) seems fine, and in fact, necessary, to me (pun not intended).

Youtube is currently *very* easy to abuse. A lot of youtubers are having their channels restricted because of strikes against their accounts, and the strikes don't even have to be legitimate.

Someone could, I don't know, make an extra Youtube account, flag the Fine Bros video as an infringement of your rights, and have a strike placed on their account. This would, and I'm using other youtubers' experiences as an example, take away their ability to make thumbnails, monetization, and their videos wouldn't be allowed to exceed 15 minutes.

Obviously, this would not be a lasting solution, but it would sure be pissing in their cheerios.

I could make an extra Youtube account and do this, but then I'd have to make another email, confirm it, yadda yadda yadda. I don't care enough to do that anymore.

She eventually gave it back, but the backlash and outrage from the community greatly diminished her reputation. Hopefully a similar outcome occurs here, too.

Also, this may seem like a silly question, but all the ""reaction"" video features tv shows, video games, etc, so can any of those companies/studios request to remove their copyrighted material? Or have they possibly signed off a deal to show it?"

The trade mark is probably invalid for lack of distinctive character and/or descriptiveness, unless the proprietor can show that it has acquired a distinctive character.

Use of the word ""reacts"" in the title of an online video is (prima facie) unlikely to be considered trade mark use (ie for the purposes of distinguishing goods/services of one undertaking from those of others), in which case there's no infringement. I'd be much more concerned by the use of the word in the name of a YouTube channel.

Someone posting a video with ""reacts"" in the title of people reacting to something ought in any event to be entitled to a defence on the basis that the sign was being used descriptively.

> Sony Computer Entertainment of America attempted to trademark the term ""Let's Play"" as applied to streaming and broadcasting of video games in the latter part of 2015, but the request was preliminarily denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office citing an existing trademark. The MacArthur Law Firm, a firm specializing in video game legal matters, filed a formal petition to the Patent and Trademark office, citing that the denial should have been based on the claim that ""Let's Play"" has become a generic trademark and any further attempts to trademark the term should be denied. Sony attempted to register the mark again in January 2016, and were again rejected, with the Patent and Trademark office stating that the term ""Let's Play"" is now too generic to be trademarked.

but I and many other people are probably not going to forgive them. 

Why? Well, I'll show you. You can read the Finebro's apology [here](https://medium.com/@FineBrothersEnt/a-message-from-the-fine-brothers-a18ef9b31777#.xuzf46gu7).

I'll debunk/examine what they have shown us.

>We realize we built a system that could easily be used for wrong. We are fixing that. The reality that trademarks like these could be used to theoretically give companies (including ours) the power to police and control online video is a valid concern, and though we can assert our intentions are pure, there’s no way to prove them.

let me read that again
>the power to police and control online video is a valid concern, and though we can assert our intentions are pure, there’s no way to prove them

Your actions speak louder then your words. We do not let a murder completely free because they stated they will never do it again. The same shall apply here.

You have flagged videos, shut down channels and led your fans against people (Ellen, for example) because they used your ""format"". Which was never yours in the first place. 

I and many people are well aware that if you never announced this trademark and went ahead with it. You would've abused it's power, because as far as i know (I'm not a lawyer. So correct me if i'm wrong) you *need* to go after people and protect your trademark, otherwise you would lose it. But despite that, you seem so entitled to your ""format"" that you would've indeed attacked other channels regardless.

>We have decided to do the following:

>1. Rescind all of our “React” trademarks and applications.*

>2. Discontinue the React World program.

>3. Release all past Content ID claims.**

Probably the best decision you've made. 
>The concerns people have about React World are understandable, and that people see a link between that and our past video takedowns, but those were mistakes from an earlier time. It makes perfect sense for people to distrust our motives here, but we are confident that our actions will speak louder than these words moving forward.

Then why would you have trademarked it in the first place? What was the point of that? Your trademark was so broad that it conveniently covered all react channels - big or small. If you had no intention of shutting down competition, you shouldn't have launched the ""react"" trademark.

>This has been a hard week. Our plan is to keep making great content with the help of our amazing staff. Thank you for your time and for hearing us out.

Wait. Give me a second...

>Our plan is to keep making great ~~content~~ **money** with the help of our amazing staff. 

FTFY. 

I strongly believe you did this all purely to make those digits in your bank rise. While others starved. Youtube is a sadly unstable source of income for many.

>Sincerely,

>Benny and Rafi Fine

>*This includes “React,” “Kids React,” “Elders React,” “Lyric Breakdown,” etc. Please note: It takes a while for the databases to update, but the necessary paperwork has been filed.

>**Content ID is YouTube’s copyright system that automatically flags content that looks like or sounds like copyrighted content. This mostly flags videos that are direct re-uploads of our videos (which is what the system is built for), but if you know of a video that has been claimed or removed incorrectly, please email us with “false claim” in the subject line.

I hope you understand that we will indeed hold you up to your statement. We will continue to watch and see if you do deal with these claims.

Also, what about videos you personally flagged? Was that a false flag? Did you know that you where abusing a broken system? (Something YouTube should fix. It's getting to the point where i would not be surprised that if this system is not fixed, Youtube might become the new MySpace in a few years. All it takes is someone who's smart enough to know how to deal with this issue.)

This entire week was a hilarious example of stupidity. The ""React World"" program was a flop (and it should be. It was extremely shady). You exposed yourselves as money-greedy morons and the world shall remember you as so.

We will remember. I think it's time we stood up to false-flags and shady money-grabbing tactics. We will use the Finebros as an example of what happens when you piss off a large portion of the internet in attempt to garner profit.

I propose we launch #RememberFineFail. Every year, on this day. We will remember how badly the screwed up, and use it as an example. As i mentioned.

You can take this response as too extreme (I think it's fine.) but non the less, I hope you take it into consideration.

Please reply if i missed anything.

On top of this it also means they have the ultimate power to police all react content, so if they personally don't like your video for what ever arbitrary reason they feel like saying they can just deny you the opportunity to put the video up entirely. Finally it also means all react videos must clearly state that they are part of the Fine Bros. company if they wish to legally be on youtube. 

This isn't competition, it is actually the exact opposite. This is two guys trying to monopolize the idea of people having a reaction to something else so no one else is allowed to create any similar content.

In his opening lines of a comment. This is just an example of one of them. There's not much people with common sense can do right about now anyway. The whole clusterfuck of pitchforks will downvote anyone who even tries to disagree that maybe, just *maybe* they're not trying to murder babies. 

Don't get me wrong, i honestly don't like TheFineBros, so i don't have any reason to defend them. But reddit is just being fucking stupid this time. I'll change my mind when i see proof and not just a circlejerk of assumptions.

Did you read any of the threads before you commented? Tons of people have posted their DCMA'd videos. And I've already posted you their deleted facebook post that instructed their fans to go attack Ellen for stealing their Kids React format. And no, Ellen did not ""blatantly copy their shows exactly"". It was literally Ellen interviewing kids and showing them old technology to get funny reactions. THAT is how vague the Fine Bros considers their ""format"". And that's only with the ""kids react"" trademark. They are almost done trademarking ""react"" itself.

I don't understand why people like you incessantly them in the face of overwhelming evidence of their motive, pattern of behavior, and actions. It's like you completely skip over all the people posting about stuff they've done and pretend like there's no evidence.

If all this isn't enough, then go make a video called kids react where you interview a bunch of kids, upload it to youtube, and see how long it lasts. There's a reason why those videos are all taken down in the past few years. Now imagine the Fine Bros expanding this control to ALL demographics once they start licensing. They can trademark every kind of react video under the sun the same way they trademarked kids/teens/elders react."

First of all, that facebook page is called ""TheFineBros Fans"". You surely can't think that's their page... right? I believe their facebook page is different. Also why would you have ""Fans"" in your own facebook page name? 

>Did you read any of the threads before you commented? Tons of people have posted their DCMA'd videos.

I read a lot, and saw no decent evidence showing TheFineBros taking down videos because of these reasons. Could you direct me to them? And do you actually know that these didn't deserve to be taken down? Did you see any of the actual videos? 

> They are almost done trademarking ""react"" itself.

They're trademarking their company, not the word. I'd say it's reasonable to not want another company called 'React' coming in doing the same thing. It's not like they're taking down videos for merely having ""react"" in the title. 

>They can trademark every kind of react video under the sun the same way they trademarked kids/teens/elders react.

Once again, they're not trademarking those. They're trademarking those shows, and all of their unique features. 

Show me a video that has been reuploaded elsewhere, that was taken down simply because there are kids/teens/elders reacting to things in it.

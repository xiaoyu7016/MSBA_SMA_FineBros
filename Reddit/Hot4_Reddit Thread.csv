We hope you've been at least not flagrantly angry about how we've handled this fairly unique event from a moderation standpoint. We've tried our best to balance keeping the discussion going with providing easy means for people who just aren't interested to opt-out of the light-blue *React Related* spam.

Clearly, /r/videos has been a major hub for this story breaking and maintaining momentum, and so it's probably in no small part because of the pressure exerted by some of you guys in keeping the discussion going that the FineBros have reversed this demonstrably unpopular decision. Whether you think that's for better or worse, that's certainly something!

For the sake of the modqueue and YouTubers across the world, let's hope that we don't have too much more React Related flair on our front-pages in the coming days and weeks.

First of all, they shouldn't include excuses like this.  It's the same type of condescending corporate double speak that got them in trouble in the first place.  Their intentions were clear and they were not pure.

**A real apology would say they're sincerely sorry, that they're retracting the trademarks and that they will work hard to prove, over time, that they will do right by the community and their fans moving forward.**

I don't see how it could be expected to get what you want from them in that immediate situation. Its a set up to be disappointed and feeling patronized. A fundamental disagreement that is going to occur unless one party changes their stance. They didn't yet believe they were doing anything wrong and concluded that it must be a misunderstanding. The opposition didn't understand how the Fine Bros. couldn't understand what they were doing was wrong and felt belittled because of it. It's natural to feel they were being patronizing because of that. 

Luckily it seems to have worked out. They were searching for answers for why people didn't agree with them. The important thing in these situations is for the person (both sides) to be open to being wrong. To be searching for understanding. Whether it be money reasons are just truly coming to realize the moral problem of their ways. They were open to change and did.

Even if we were to assume that it was just a misunderstanding of intention that everyone was upset at them, why did they need to wait until they were losing subscribers by the minute to have this epiphany you're talking about? The apology is textbook damage control, they're saying it not because they want to, but because they need to.

I can see where they maybe intended it to go conceptually. We have this specific format. If someone wanted to start a series like ""Russians React"" or ""Sanders supporters react"" they would offer tools and support to them. In exchange there would be profit sharing.

They probably wanted to trademark it to protect themselves from having that help taken advantage of. They used the phrase ""beat by beat reproduction""

Project Runway and The Apprentice are similar concepts, but have different formats. A better example is Top Chef and MasterChef/HellsKitchen.

The formats are specific but they are close, they do not infringe on anyone's trademarks.

The problem with react world is that they didn't build up enough good will with the community for us to buy into it.

Their concept isn't much different than kids say the darndest things or what Ellen did. However if you were to take all branding out, you would be able to know the difference between a video that is by the Fine Bros and one that isn't. Like /u/videogamelawyer said, they are one of the best at what they do. 

I can see the value of the concept they were trying to build, and why they would want to protect themselves and their potential partners. Execution was poor, and they had little goodwill.

I get home, and call him over with a flat look on my face. I keep my tone level as I tell him, ""Here son, I bought you this"". His face is unmoving. He was born before the great inertion of 2016, but his school trains him well. He holds out his hands and takes the plainly wrapped box from my hands.  
""This present is most welcome"" he recites, one of the few FineBros approved responses licensed for non-commercial use by the public. His hands tear off the brown paper, slowly, steadily, without excitement. He sees the present now. A flicker of fear crossed his eyes, I could see it, I'm his father. I know what he's feeling. Shit shit, don't let them see son, don't... My sons eyes dart upwards. Shit, shit, I knew he'd like the present, he's reacting... He holds the case firmly as tears well up in his eyes. I knew I should have fucking got him something else, this is my fault, I knew how much he wanted this game... It's too late. He lets the smile spread across his face for the first time in 7 years. Its beautiful...  
The alarms go off, I make sure not to flinch, not to react. I know its only a matter of minutes now before he's taken.  
As I let my eyes glaze over and rest on a point safely above his head he drops to the floor and wraps his arms around my legs. ""I love you dad, thankyou, thankyou"" he sobs. I stay focused on that crease in the wallpaper. I can't be sent to the camps with him, his sister needs me. I control my breathing, in... out. In... out. The cameras on our living room ceiling whir as they zoom in, capturing the action for the FineBros and their audience. But not for me. I will not watch the video of them dragging him away, I will not watch his mother react as she watches it. I will not watch the video of her reacting to it either. I refuse to, none of them.

And I'm not going to lie, he's partially right -- Reddit truly does have a hive mind problem.

But here's the thing: the internet is basically the world. No, it's not *actually* the world, because the internet still isn't feasible in very large chunks of the world, but for all intents and purposes, the internet makes up everyone -- every opinion possible, even socially unacceptable ones.

So here's the rub: he's saying ""not to side with the internet"". Well, the Fine Bros. are an internet organization, monetizing internet videos, including content they did not create.

There are three camps on the internet: Those that see them for what they are, who are lashing back against then, those who don't care, and the Fine Bros fanboys who defend them in spite of their scumbaggery being brought to light.

Since it is something entirely internet based, because it's about a company based around the internet, his argument falls apart. Friend or not, I would tell him straight up that he's being an idiot by attempting to make the argument that ""the internet is a bunch of sheep"", when he's more guilty than any of us for it, by both following one side of the internet's argument and by doing it in spite of everything piling up.

I'm going to say this clearly and bluntly: Loyalty is bred by obtaining something. A quality, tangible product. A friend having your back. Your family.

The loyalty people have to a group that has monetized them at every corner, who treat them as dollar bills, and indeed who are not actually providing a solid product that beats all competition, is so fallacious I would have trouble taking him seriously.

When you follow a channel for sometime you start to develop a connection with the creator. Although I don't follow these guys, I do follow other youtubers closely. It doesn't mean you put them on a pedestal, as they are after all running the channel for profit, but you expect them to keep their behaviour to a certain standard.

And lets not downplay these guys even though their content maybe stupid to some people. They have a huge channel(~14mil subs). What makes these guys untrustworthy is the fact they are using shady ways to kill off competition and then trying to lie about it and cover it up. And considering the size of their channel, it wasn't really needed. Its just ambition.

A real world comparison can be made with the Leno/Conan fiasco. Everyone loved Leno, until he forcefully took the Tonight Show from Conan. Or the Lance Armstrong scandal. He was a favored athlete. But after the doping stuff came out, it was disheartening for a lot of people. We all know that these guys are super competitive in their fields, but when they start doing something that falls in the grey area it will cause people to act out.

No, but it doesn't make them *more* trustworthy.

There are many more large channels who are not doing this, which does makes them more trustable than FineBros.

I can go back to the example in my previous comment about Leno/Conan. People always knew NBC isn't the nicest company in the world but they still tuned in to watch Leno as they liked him. So when he forced his way back on the show, people hated on Leno more than NBC, as they kinda expected to NBC to do shitty things but they didn't expect Leno to go along with it.

As for shady or not, when you start copyrighting words like 'React' and try to claim a format/genre you didn't create as your own, it definitely falls in a grey area.

Issuing takedown requests like that when it's related to trademark and not copyright is a violation of copyright law. Their liability is [explained as such](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512):

>(f) Misrepresentations. - Any person who knowingly materially misrepresents under this section —

>(1) that material or activity is infringing, or

>(2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification,

>shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner's authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.

Edit: in other words, I agree with you. If you get a DMCA takedown request and there's not in fact any copyright infringement going on, then you should definitely continue to dispute it. In this context, it would force The Fine Bros. to either drop the takedown request or sue, and if they attempt to sue when it's not actually a copyright issue then that opens them up to a counter suit.

If you're curious or interested, do some google searching for ""Long Play"" videos.

Sometimes people would cut boring stuff so they could grind off camera, or if they failed waaay to many times, they'd say ""you know what? fuck it, I'm gonna pause until I get this"" but it was just part of the show.

I didn't realize (but guess I'm not surprised) that the big players will add production value and cut shit out or modify stuff to make it more streamlined. That's not a ""Let's Play"" to me, that's a commercial for a video game. A true ""Let's Play"" is just someone playing the game more or less as they normally would, with as little editing as possible, if any. Though I don't mind some of the intros, or when a player will speed up a part while they solve a complex puzzle or something. Stuff like that doesn't bug me.

- Censored and removed comments on their videos so that it looked like the community was having a positive reaction to React World
- **Outright said** that these trademarks were *not* going to be used to take down other people's reaction videos (obviously this is not true)
- Attacked fellow YouTube accounts for making reaction videos that in no way resembled their own reaction videos (looking at you guy who made a reaction video with 8 views that got flagged)
- Continually spoke down to their entire fanbase and the internet at large as if we were too stupid to actually understand the situation
- Made one of the *most* condescending ""apology"" videos to ever exist
- Took down their React World related videos and posted this ""apology"" on another site - erasing this fiasco from their social media accounts.

Now here's what they did not do: Answer any direct questions about React World. They never clarified how these trademarks were going to be used in a positive way to benefit their franchisees. The Fine Brothers never apologized on camera.

That last fact alone, I think, is proof that this apology is also insincere. They couldn't fool the internet the first time on camera, so perhaps a PR company written apology will do the trick. 

They only ""apologized"" after losing at least 250,000 subscribers (many of whom are very active subscribers), after getting bad press from every major online news outlet, after people wrote and complained to their sponsors about this behavior. 

Everything about this - from the initial concept to this - is shady. This apology is bullshit - don't resubscribe and don't trust these guys.

**Edit:** And this is TRADEMARKS not COPYRIGHTS. I've taught you all nothing :P 

**EDIT 2:** Benny Fine has given me proof that they surrendered registration of TEENS REACT and KIDS REACT, and they have abandoned their applications for ELDERS REACT, REACT, PARENTS REACT, CELEBRITIES REACT, ADULTS REACT, TRY NOT TO LAUGH, LYRIC BREAKDOWN, KIDS VS FOOD, DO THEY KNOW IT, and PEOPLE VS TECHNOLOGY. 

That means they've abandoned ALL marks that were in question. They heard our collective voice, and they responded. While, sure, this response was driven mostly by fear and a lightning fast unsubscribe rate, there’s no reason to keep our foot on the gas.

Is what they did initially right? No, of course not. But I didn’t offer my services to destroy their company or see endless employees laid off, and I hope you didn’t either. The internet gets hungry with vengeance, I know, but these are peoples’ lives. People who made a huge mistake, but a mistake they’ve corrected. 

I hope you let people who enjoy the Fine Bros work continue to do so. I hope you don’t troll their comment section or lead brigades against their content. They don’t own the react genre, but it would be silly to say they aren’t one of the best at it.

Thanks for keeping the web a little bit freer and thanks for setting a much needed precedent. This was our line in the sand. Thanks again for your work and your help.**

I would also like to point out that the same people who spent years harassing everyone from small time creators to big names like Ellen, Jimmy Kimmel, and Buzzfeed, and who spent years and thousands of dollars in legal fees to trademark existing internet trends like ""try not to laugh or smile"" and ""react"" are not, overnight, different people. Their thought processes have not changed, watch their video and read the tone of this letter, they are angry at you for being confused not because they actually think they are wrong. **The only reason they are giving up these trademarks is because their upcoming Youtube TV show ""Sing It"" is going to be released in a couple of months and they want to do anything possible to save its release from the bad publicity.** 

**EDIT** This whole situation looked like it quickly and easily resolved itself but **behind the scenes, Ryan and other attorneys received a lot of push back.** First of all, maybe a handful of people like Ryan Morrison were actively spending their time fighting for us. It seemed like Mr. Morrison had the whole internet's backing and easily ""took care"" of this for us, **[but he was pretty alone when he had to deal with the insults Philip DeFranco hurled at him while he worked on this case for us.](http://imgur.com/ZqI15aE)** I should note that Philip DeFranco has reversed his position and [admitted that he spent days throwing insults at Ryan without actually having read anything about this situation beyond a few tweets.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_3HESGr52A) But Philip DeFranco is friends with The Fine Bros and even invited the brothers to his wedding last year, so it's understandable why he went after any critics so harshly. **Still, props for slugging through that BS while fighting for us Ryan.**

Behind the scenes, **it was disturbing how close The Fine Bros came to getting away with it all.** The first thread that was made about The Fine Bros [was actually mistakenly taken down.](http://imgur.com/TSYGmp3) 

Here is what the original React World video looked like after the first thread was removed: https://imgur.com/yDHRwLU Before the first thread was posted, the video only had 250 thumbs downs. Seemed like everyone was going along with this and The Fine Bros were actively deleting any comments that asked about their attempt to trademark ""React"". So when I kept saying that they were great at PR over the past few days, that's what I was referring to. They were extremely skilled at presenting what they were doing as a great thing and actively keeping out any discussions about what they were really doing. It seems obvious in retrospect what kind of shady thing they were doing, but at the time, it was not obvious to most people at all.

But thanks to the moderators for stepping in and helping with the second thread. **Special thanks to /u/Meepster23 who really went the extra mile to take care of the second thread.** If you read that thread, Meepster was all over it and helped set up the impromptu AMA.

Also, thank you to all the associates of The Fine Bros who offered to provide information both publicly and privately even under potential legal threats. A lot of the evidence and information from years ago were found with their help. It's great knowing that despite being close associates of The Fine Bros, so many people cared enough about internet freedom and the open meritocratic/democratic culture of Youtube to step up and set a precedent against this money grab. **[I really can't imagine what it's like working with The Fine Bros when former employees posting here on Reddit were scared that one of The Fine Bros made a reddit account to trick him/her into revealing his/her identity.](http://imgur.com/GYeAea0)** And based on what I am hearing, The Fine Bros are still absolutely fuming about being forced to give up their trademarks. I do hope that if they try to resubmit their trademarks again or do something else shady, that we can come together again to fight it.

Thanks to all of you for putting up with my endless walls of texts. Thanks for informing other people. I know some of you hate this ""drama"" by now and hate me by now, but thanks for paying attention. We all benefited from pushing back against what The Fine Bros were doing.

**Edit 2 Linked to the wrong photo, this was the DeFranco twitter exchange with Ryan: http://imgur.com/ZqI15aE** After re-reading those tweets... yikes wtf DeFranco? Props again /u/VideoGameAttorney for fighting the good fight.

**EDIT 3: Apparently DeFranco deleted those tweets and is furious about one of his fans sending his tweet screencap to me and now Ryan is getting EVEN MORE twitter backlash from his fans. Wtf DeFranco? STOP ALREADY? Just got a message from Ryan and Phil's apologized to him so please stop tweeting Ryan.**

Now, EVERY SINGLE online trend will have someone trying to trademark it. Harlem shake? Yea, someone could trademark that format. And they will be successful unless they are found out because the ones approving trademarks likely have no idea what internet trends are.

This is what The Fine Bros do. They look at what's popular, copy it, and the trademark it. That's why they went after ""react"", and then ""try not to smile or laugh"", and then ""opinions"", and even ""gaming"". That's right, they even trademarked the ""format"" of people playing video games and us watching them.

The fact these things got approved means we have no protect at the government level. They don't understand what is going on on the internet. So now, the pandora's box is opened. The next time you see an internet trend like the ice bucket challenge, the condom challenge, etc, expect a trademark to get filed. The Fine Bros showed that it can be done.

As for The Fine Bros, they are not changed people. Again, they are angry at all of us. They would have gotten away with what they were doing like they have for years if they just kept things quiet. They were taking down individual channels and content creators. This means the majority of us won't know about what they're doing and most people wouldn't even believe you if you told them that they were doing these things. It wasn't until a massive disaster happened that all those individual stories of victimization came forward and convinced everyone that The Fine Bros were abusing the system.

I'm afraid that The Fine Bros will continue to use their very close ties to Youtube to continue abusing the system and pushing out competition through underhanded tactics. Their problem is their business model is built on earning money on cheap and easy content, so they need to artificially put up barriers to entry in order to keep competition away.

Just to clarify (not that I think you have it wrong, just to make it more clear) you don't have to register a trademark, but if you do register the trademark is presumed valid and the burden is on the other party to show that it's not valid/outside your field or what have you. If its not a registered mark then you have the burden of showing that it's valid first before they even have to mount a defense.

The DMCA describes a system where a rights holder asserts a claim to the publisher (like YouTube), and the publisher presumes it's true, notifies the user.  The user then can make a counter-claim, deny the original claim, and the publisher is supposed to restore the content, and then exit the process and allow the Courts to take over as the two parties duke it out in Court.

Instead YouTube took the basics of the system, put all the eggs on the one side, made a too automatic appeals process, and then tried to pretend it's not in the loop.

The DMCA describes a process which works by consent or withholding it, and then filing regular old enforcement suits.  It actually would be better to revert to a system like this because YouTube wouldn't be doing anything, it would be just facilitating claims back and forth, before finally letting the parties appeal to a real Court for a decision.  Instead you appeal to a stupid algorithm or an outsourced schmuck in who knows where.",2/2/2016,t1,czko1li

1545,czkp6vv,t3_43sdch,1454390815,oprahwindfree,150,0,0,0,150,"The Fine Bros apology is meaningless. The surrendering of trademarks is meaningless. What matters is for years they have been using their popularity to bully others they felt threatened their quest to illegally corner a certain aspect of YouTube. They have generated millions of dollars...millions...each year. The only great idea they had was to COPY a popular format from TV and take the $$$ they had made as a partner the first few years (making LOST parodies and dressing up like Burger King mind you) and make a react video series. They had the money to make it look like a TV show and they got there first. That is all they did. They made a very profitable channel(s). They even had a TV show. They were doing great. 

Behind the scenes as they kept gaining popularity, they were doing things that showed their true colors (many did not know about these things until brave people came forward btw):
1) Filing copyright claims against their competition.
2) Using the Content ID system to block the competition.
3) Sending their fan bases to attack Ellen, Buzzfeed, and who knows who else.

No one in the mass general public outside of Youtube and even some within Youtube had any idea these three things were happening.

They decided to trademark these general titles, not to prevent people from making react videos (they were already doing that where they could up w the 3 things above), they wanted to take down ALL of the ones that did react videos. Everyone that did not go through them was going to feel their wrath. The kicker was on top of using the legal system to bully Youtubers, they wanted a percentage of $ of the videos that do go through them. It is the equivalent of a Youtube mobster or a Youtube lunchroom bully ""pay for protection kid"" system.

It goes against every single thing Youtube was built on. Regardless of how crazy big companies have made Youtube, no one had any idea...one of their own...one of the creators that used fair use to get big...one that used a popular culture idea that had been around for years...one that people watched, looked up to, actually liked...was going to turn into a big greedy monster that every single Youtuber, redditor, etc. has loathed since the beginning of trying to protect the internet from corporate BS. That is what they did. They cannot take it back. Nothing will ever make it right.

They made a video giving out their scheme because they really wanted to make money off of those creators ""stealing"" their formats. They made the 2nd video talking down to everyone and playing victim because they really wanted to make money off of those creators ""stealing"" their formats. They tried to censor the outrage but they couldn't. They made the decision to release a statement (a full week after the first video mind you and after losing a lot of subscribers, fans, etc.) to make this go away. They want to put this in the rearview mirror so they can move on to making more millions even if it was less than what they had planned.

They are not victims. They are not really losing that much revenue than they already had. They have still have 13+ million subscribers and BILLIONS of views that will still generate them millions this year alone. They are in no way, shape or form in danger as a company to be laying off people they employ. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS CRAP. They are SAD because everyone now knows how they gamed the Youtube system in the past and tried to game it in a major way this week by trademarking every damn thing they could to do it. This was a calculated, greedy plan to exploit creators that were either too poor revenue-wise to fight them or too naive to care. Even if they lost everything today, every video and channel, they would still be millionaires. 

No one should forgive them. They are millionaires who tried to screw over Youtube creators that they saw might be taking that little bit of attention or $ from them and their channels. Why would anyone want to continue watching them knowing what we do now? They sicken me and should to anyone who is out there watching, supporting, or making Youtube videos. They don't care about what people think and never did. They only cared about taking every single dollar they could for themselves regardless if it was at the expense of a fellow Youtube creator or not.

Forget them and their pity party.

With the two evidences combined, we would be be F'd if they chose to exert that power. I bet they will continue to have success from the majority of their viewer group.  To be fair, most of reddit didn't subscribe to them and probably rarely, if ever, watched their content.  The backlash from reddit onto YT, facebook, twitter, etc. Caused the subscriber base number to fall only slightly and barely lessened video views over the short term and once we stop talking about it their numbers will normalize again.  Even during the live count they had many new subs but they were outweighed by the massive jump off.  Famous people tend to fight till the bitter end of the PR guy rope before they give up and I'm sure by the time the new show hits they'll be back to normal.

Just recently for example, Valve took moves to ban modded guns on private servers in CS:GO. That is to say, on your own server with your own resources, if you play with something you didn't buy from the mod store, your account will get a ban.

The other issue is that mods have zero quality control, and it discourages cooperation. After all, are the developers on the extensive mods, things like SkyUI, just going to release their code *for free* when someone else could copy it and reupload it and charge oodles? No way. So they will charge themselves. So if I have a great idea to improve SkyUI I could code in... well tough shit. It hurts open source a LOT.

What Steam needs as far as mods go is the ability to categorize, index, and sync them, as well as adding the *OPTION* to *DONATE* to mod authors, and promoting this option heavily with like a special front page for the Mods section that looks like the store front page, and highlights donate options.

But if the mod scene is a paid-enterprise from start to finish, you wind up with a world of terrible DLC that has no quality control, can break your game, and might not even belong to the person who uploaded it. And there are SOooooooo many more mods than people to verify these things, the idea they could police it to prevent this kind of fraud is absurd.

But that doesn't invalidate the other problems. Look at Steam Greenlight. It's a cesspool of garbage being sold as full titles, with no quality control at all. Most everyone I know avoids it entirely because of this. Now imagine that, but being sold as something to use *within* you game. That can break and ruin it if done wrong.

Now that's a problem with existing titles that had mods that were allowed to have free reign. But when Just Cause 4 comes out, and wants to get some easy money with Steam Mods, they aren't going to want 400 pages of tech support claims because of your shitty interface mod that breaks the game.

How do you protect against that? Well the only way you can, you'd have to limit what mods can access and do, heavily. So things like SkyUI go out the window. Things that can crash and render your game invalid? Gone.

I support adding a larger mod database, syncing, and support via steam. And I support making a way for mod makers to earn revenue on items that prove to be worthwhile. But I don't support the idea of making mods paid as a standard. That discourages open-source sharing in mod communities, and further discourages companies from allowing modding to be an open process (if it's open, it can be coped/stolen, and that is lost DLC money.)

I wish I had a great solution, but I don't. I want a way to ""subscribe"" to mod makers via steam, that lets me give them some money in return for their services, WITHOUT tying that to particular mods. Like imagine if you could subscribe to a mod maker, and pay it out in like, steam trading cards or inventory items. Or do it like Wikipedia: have a mod support fund, where modders get a kickback based on pageviews, downloads, and overall reviews of their products.

There are other ideas that would encourage sharing and code-collaboration, while still offering a way to support modders financially. But reducing their work into DLC packages isn't it.",2/2/2016,t1,czkoenp

If some dude wants to make a mod for Skyrim and charge for it, how is that a bad thing? If you don't like it, don't buy it. There will be a torrent of it out 3 minutes after it's uploaded to Steam, anyways.

1641,czku5yg,t3_43sdch,1454405692,ocassionallyaduck,1,0,0,0,1,"Valve were the ones who approved and *highlighted* the problematic mods initially. So no, it took the community to expose some of these problems. 

Valve could hardly keep up with the fraud problems and complaints, and this was with ONE game and having all the attention on it. Many of the mods that charged money straight up didn't function when installed. And if it did take off? Do you think that the next titles to implement modding would support non-steam mods as well? Doubtful, why leave money on the table?

So now the crazy fun of modding would be massively restricted by the amount you're willing to invest. That's no longer modding, it's DLC. It's $5 costume packs for fighting games, only no longer even made by the company.

Imagine if this was just how they planned to do it in most new titles. Nobody has the amount of staff required to vet and approve all these mods.

Also newer titles, like Metal Gear Solid V, are still not cracked online. I mention this because you say people can just pirate the mods if they didn't wanna pay. Well, not indefinitely, encryption is getting tougher to break for casual projects like modding. And why pirates may win, the idea that the same teams that take weeks to crack HUGE titles like MGSV would waste their time on encrypted mod packages is ludicrous.

So when Fallout 5 releases, and decides to only support mods from the steam store from day one, that's okay? And when those mods are limited to only changing textures and resources, and the Creation Kit no longer supports advanced scripting? This has to happen too, to protect shitty paid mods from ruining your game. Again, money changing hands changes things here, there is an ENTIRELY different level of minimum quality control expected if you are paying for something. If I download a armor set for $7 that corrupts my entire install, that is not okay. And this happens with mods, a lot. Even when you're careful. So mods will have to be limited to prevent this.

The game itself will have some form of DRM probably. But these DLC packages are not assets now, and will be encrypted as well to protect their worth. So the idea you can just download them all and slip them in like a pirate is also a non-starter. Especially since the game will just verify with steamworks what you own and not show anything else.

1646,czkumba,t3_43sdch,1454407726,ocassionallyaduck,1,0,0,0,1,"Well, in the case of iOS and Android titles, it's a shitty situation. There should be a way to sandbox these titles to work on newer devices, and I kind of blame Apple and Google for not giving any shits about this. But also developers who didn't code it right the first time. A huge number of titles still work on the latest mobile OSes that were either very simple, or programmed smartly from the start. But we're getting off track. Suffice it to say this is a problem too, and I think the answer is going to have to come from Google and Apple. It's also thankfully not overly-common (limited to ancient apps, very specialized apps, and expensive 3D games which cause the biggest stink.) It will eventually need to be addressed though.

When it comes to games and mods though, be real here, when was the last time ANY game on Steam offered you an ""optional"" patch. You can't even opt-out in settings anymore. Only choose ""this game first"" or leave it to be updated whenever. I was surprised to find this out, but you seriously cannot refuse a patch on Steam games any longer.

If the modder is being paid, so is the dev under this system. So the developer has accepted your money for the mod as well, and a decent amount of it. Now, if you don't think they should have any responsibility for mods, then I don't see why they should get any of this money. They are literally doing none of the work, and modders only *add value* to their base product. 

Now, while some modders might keep up with the title due to popularity like you suggest (SkyUI for example), others might just abandon their work. What about the less popular mods? The random-ass $5 mod for a Go-kart in Dragon Age: Spanish Inquisition that only got 2,000 downloads. The dev already spent that money, and moved to where the real money was at: nudie mods. So your Go-cart is now broken forever. Worse, you don't know *how* it's broken. There's no QA, so you would just have to try and see, and when it ruins your gamesave or your entire install, well that's too bad.

So as a consumer, you're left with something that only worked for a few months, is past the refund period, and was basically designed to be disposable. And ALL THAT might not be so bad, if the mod were free, or open sourced. But it's not. So no other dev can just hop in to fix it like happens now with older projects.

I commented elsewhere here about it, but I totally support modders getting some money and financial support for their efforts. (this is just something I *just* wrote. it's not bulletproof as an idea) but I think it makes much more sense to treat is like a patreon system or some kind of pooled distribution. Have popularity and downloads factor in. Require the code to be open and shared for all posted mods. Design it to reward modders for their skill instead of their product, so that everyone can collaborate. And keep it free for those not involved in the Steam Marketplace. Steam users have already shown they are willing to put their money out there to support modders when given the chance. They just *hate* the system. So make a better system.",2/2/2016,t1,czku5w9

They are getting worse because you are so used to them and you have most likely already purchased the games that go on sale that you want.

If it is not your benefit disable all of your account security options and let someone gain access to your account.

99% of the world has no law on refunds on games. If they did then Valve would not have been able to get away with it.

True... I got nothing to say to this. Valve's CS needs to pick it up.

Well ya... kinda like any business. Thankfully everything they monetize on their own games are just cosmetic stuff.

Regardless if they are a business they do deserve credit and loyalty when it is earned.

He *really* understands gamers, and the community and the technological culture *we* thrive in. Remember, he was working on the Windows operating systems in the early 90's for Microsoft.. The same time the internet slowly grew and exploded in what it is today. He's very familiar with online culture, because he is a true member of it.

His business isn't traditional by any means. There is no ""CEO"", there are no bosses. Every single employee of his company can interact directly with anyone else within the company. Teams of creators, from the top to the bottom of the ladder always share the same open workspace. There are no titles, and no one is looked down upon. 

They've never bought into the 'pay to win' scheme, ever. You can pay for hats and guns, but you'll *never* gain an advantage by using cash. This has literally created a secondary *private* economy, one that Valve has yet to take advantage of (And never will). When that rare hat for TeamFortress2 privately sells between two users, and some of these hats are worth tens of thousands (I think one of the most expensive items sold in TF2 was around 17k) Valve makes nothing. These items can even be earned for free, by way of random drops. Can you imagine playing a video game and randomly receiving $17,000? I don't think I've ever heard of this type of serious market being created because of any other game (Besides counter strike). I'm sure there may be others though, but Valve were the first. 

Edit: I stand corrected, steam takes a transaction fee for items sold on the marketplace. I, and many other still feel it's negligible because you're still receiving free money.

Although secretive, Gabe and his company are extremely honest; a rare and valuable trait in the gaming industry these days. They don't promise anything they can't or won't deliver. (Usually they don't say a god damn thing)

These are just a few things that set him and his business apart from other game companies on the same level. He deserves every bit of praise. All he *needs* to do is get a dedicated customer service staff for the Steam platform.. and people are guaranteed to bow in his direction twice a day.

Correct, but I would say most of the transactions take place on steam, which means that while steam isn't taking a percentage, you're essentially giving someone a steam gift card in place of real cash.

People saying that this was just a backtrack, that they retracted this only because they got caught, or that they had always intended to use this maliciously, you may be right. It's impossible for us to know what they planned or what could have happened. What's important is that it was stopped. 

I think we should also learn, as a community, to police these kinds of situations better. Had they said nothing, would anyone have noticed? Would anything have been done about it? Maybe their intentions were really good, but that could always change in the future, so giving them that kind of power in the broken system that is YouTube is a scary thought.

Every baker had to have their own mark on their work, either by stamp or pinprick, so that if there was 'any bread faultie in weight, it may be knowne in whom the fault is'. Essentially this was the first mark applied to peoples work in order to protect the goodwill associated with the quality of that work, since all bread and ale barrel was to have a standard weight and quality.

True, the first trade mark laws came in the 19th century to formally declare criminal offenses to anyone who imitated a mark, but 1266 was the earliest documented case of marks being applied to goods which was enforced by law. Kinda the earliest ancestors of modern trademarks which sort of grew out from there.

> they add a clarifying video saying they don't plan on doing anything reddit is complaining about,

They are already guilty of things they claim they weren't doing. They have already abused their influence to brigade anyone who does a reaction video - and reaction videos aren't even something they came up with. They copied that idea from others.

But what's really egregious about this is that what they are saying about their plans is *factually false.*

When you register a trademark, you are required to enforce your trademark consistently and widely. If you don't enforce your trademark consistently or if you overlook instances of its use, it dilutes your trademark and at that point you may as well not even have it. It loses all its legal power.

Their trademarks were on the word ""react.""

That means that any time someone uses the word ""react"" in relation to a video, *they have to get that video licensed.* And that means *everyone*. Even if they're not using a similar format. *Everyone* who makes anything like a react video must pay Fine Bros. *Even if they don't make money.*

YouTube strikes will take away a content creator's ability to monetize their account, it prohibits the maximum length videos they can upload, and it subjects them to much greater scrutiny. And Fine Bros were giving content creators strikes and taking down their accounts (some older than their's) because they focused on reaction videos.

All the while, they were saying they weren't going to do that. They outright lied here on Reddit saying ""we won't do that,"" when there was evidence they totally were. People tried calling them out on it on Facebook and YouTube, but they deleted all comments that didn't support them. Their ""update"" follow up video (now removed) would have comments disabled, scrubbed, and disabled again because they couldn't delete the backlash fast enough.

This isn't a bunch of pissy kids getting paranoid and punishing a big YouTube company on a bunch of ""what if"" Minority Report speculation. Fine Bros crossed the ""what if"" line almost immediately after trademarking the word ""react,"" and they were exploiting YouTube's very flawed algorithms and systems in anti-competitive fashions.

This absolutely had to be done, and saying ""I'm sorry"" doesn't fix anything. They showed their intentions and how they felt towards the YouTube community. YouTube is already having enough problems with movie studios and record labels nuking entire channels with blatant disregard to Fair Use and abusing the DMCA. Having one of YouTube's largest channels attempt to monopolize a video genre older than YouTube itself, using similarly abusive tactics to exploit the DMCA system, and uphold a vague trademark on the word ""react""?

Can someone copy your channel? Sort of. Let's say  you wanted to make 'tech review' videos. Even if your name is Linus, you very probably can't make tech review videos and call it ""Linus Tech Tips"", or use any artwork, graphics, sounds, etc. that is copied from, is substantially similar to, or creates a likelihood of confusion with, Linus' channel. Or any other channel, for that matter.

You 'clear' your copyrights, trademarks, branding, graphics, sounds, material, content, etc., by looking for others' works and brands that you might conflict with. It's a chore. It can be expensive.

You do not register a trademark application without being fully cognizant of the fact that the law *REQUIRES* you to go around threatening lawsuits if someone uses your trademark in a related area.

Being that it covers *an entire medium* and uses a key word that covers an entire *category* of content, that means that they are required by law to enforce their mark REACT™ on *every* video that focuses on reacting to something. It's not something they're allowed to pick-and-choose on. Either they enforce it completely or they lose their trademark, and their licenses become essentially null and void.

By definition you *cannot* have pure intentions when you register a trademark that's this generally-applicable.

And they can't just say, ""ok, you've already got several reaction videos, we'll just license that to you for a token dollar so we can keep our trademark."" No, that'd set a precedent. That sets the value of their trademark at one dollar. They'd never pay their lawyers at that rate.

Apple is for computer and technology.  There are other Apple based named companies with trademarked names with Apple in their names that are not associated with the technology at all.  Apples have nothing to do with technology; they're a food.  So they're unrelated though the word was common.  Cause food =/= a computer.  If they were trying to come up with some awesome new desert and tried to call it Apple they'd have been shut down, for example, cause it would be confusing to the public.  (I mean it's not like seeds don't fuk farmers and the public over anyway and that's why are food costs so much in the United States since they're 'enhanced' and crap)

Google, Parent company Alphabet, an Internet based company, can't stop you from talking about the Alphabet, the part of the English language and using it in Education.  Internet company =/= English language and Education.  A lot of people prove that daily on the Internet.

The Fine Bros were filing something for ""React"" trademarking a type of video style they were creating.  A type of video style that already existed and was already being called such.

They were trademarking their shows, Kids react, Elders react and so on and also their channel name REACT. But, in order to file the trademark you have to file an application, as you already know. In this application you have to write a lot of shit, describing the look and feel of your product, in this case videos on the Internet. 

That is what most people seem leave out in this discussion. Even if all their trademarks went through, anyone who wanted to make a reaction video still could. What they could not do, is make a video that is called Kids react, or called something else but is more or less a copy, within the description in the filed trademark. That also goes for the REACT trademark, that people were most worried about. We can't see the application, but I assume it is for their channel of the same name. That would mean you could not create a network or portal of videos on the Internet called REACT in all caps. It won't stop people from making reaction videos, and TFB would not have unlimited power over the word react as many people like to think.

The Fine Bros have a youtube channel where they film people in different demographics(kids, teens, elders) reacting to youtube videos and ask them questions after they watch it, they trademarked some terms like ""Kids React"" and ""React"". Then they announced a licensing program called ""React World"" where people could use their name and ""format"" for a percentage of their revenue. They lost almost 300k subscribers in a few days after announcing this. That should be all the background information you need to understand the link.

We’re here to apologize.
We realize we built a system that could easily be used for wrong. We are fixing that. The reality that trademarks like these could be used to theoretically give companies (including ours) the power to police and control online video is a valid concern, and though we can assert our intentions are pure, there’s no way to prove them.
We have decided to do the following:
1. Rescind all of our “React” trademarks and applications.*
2. Discontinue the React World program.
3. Release all past Content ID claims.**
The concerns people have about React World are understandable, and that people see a link between that and our past video takedowns, but those were mistakes from an earlier time. It makes perfect sense for people to distrust our motives here, but we are confident that our actions will speak louder than these words moving forward.
This has been a hard week. Our plan is to keep making great content with the help of our amazing staff. Thank you for your time and for hearing us out.
Sincerely,
Benny and Rafi Fine

2944,czkvjvr,t3_43sdch,1454411907,Salohacin,1,0,0,0,1,"Can someone explain something(s) to me?

1) React videos? What the heck are they? I just... I simply can't fathom why people watch them. It's just painfully cringey an all-together pointless (although that can be said about a lot of things on the internet to be fair). This is obviously just my opinion, I can't stand the stuff so I think of it as poor, bland and uninteresting. I might say the same about a pizza because I don't like anchovies, doesn't mean it isn't a quality pizza. 

The reason I watch youtube videos (and other media to an extent) is so I can react myself to it. To experience whatever video/picture/book etc. I'm watching/looking at/reading. The goosebumps when I get to a particularly riveting part, the laughs when a quip is struck, the manly crying when it gets emotional. Obviously this is not true for all things, I *watch* documentaries to be informed on the subject at hand as a primary matter (even if they are interesting that's just a bonus).

It's the same reason I detest laughter tracks. Do people like them? And if so why? I can't stand the things. They just drive me batty. I'm watching show X because it's funny and I like the humour, not because I like listening to random people's laughs that dominate the sound track. I've long wished for an option to disable/enable laugh tracks like you might with subtitles.

2) Fine Brothers. Who are they? Never heard of them until this debacle and I'm confident in saying I'm glad I hadn't. I realise they make these 'react' videos. Is that it? Is it all react this and react that or is there any original content they come up with.

3) How big a scandal is this? Has it simply been blown out of proportion or is it actually a massive affair? I've seen tons of youtubers post videos accusing them of this and that but how much of it is true? I'm not saying these youtubers aren't credible themselves but perhaps they are just as confused as I am and aren't fully informed on the situation. The only youtuber I knew of beforehand that's done one is [Dan Bull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHSn-PaaZFY) and if I know him at all he's a good man to trust.

4) Are there any pro Fine Brother people out there still? Were they well-regarded beforehand? Had they ever done anything like this before. From what I've seen they've handled it terribly which is (in my opinion) why this is such a shit-storm. 

EDIT: What's this business with them accusing Ellen Degeneres? Heard her name pop up during the Dan Bull rap but had no idea what he was on about at the time. Seems like David vs. Goliath if they wanted to try and take on her. Far more credible than they are.

Cheers.

So far everything I've been seeing indicates that this has been an issue of trademark and not copyright. I keep seeing the word copyright being used when I've yet to see anything that seems to deal with copyright. Am I mistaken?

If I'm not mistaken, then the use of DMCA takedown requests would be an abuse of the DMCA system since that only applies to copyright and not trademark, which would potentially [open The Fine Bros. up to legal liability](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512):

>(f) Misrepresentations. - Any person who knowingly materially misrepresents under this section —
(1) that material or activity is infringing, or
(2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification,
shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner's authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.

So now my question is, ""why has no one fully disputed their use of DMCA takedown requests?"" Unless I'm mistaken and copyright is in fact a major part of this issue, ~~all that's necessary would be to force The Fine Bros. to take legal action~~ this is an obvious abuse of the DMCA which if The Fine Bros. pursue [opens them up to the possibility of getting countersued](http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=13f9814f-b56e-4314-8e1b-95215ce60a6d).

For me, the part that is so maddening is that these assholes actually believe if someone did a react video, they (Fine Bros.) deserved compensation for it (see the Ellen tweets and Facebook post).  They obviously believe that nonsense.  Their format is not unique.  They didn't come up with the idea.

They could've taken down some of the people that are trying to save YouTube from the shit hole it's in, like h3h3Productions, Pyrocynical, iDubbbz, the list goes on; hell, YouTube as a whole would've taken a huge blow overtime if this was still on course of happening.
They've lost near 300K+ subscribers and this will keep on going down and down and the hate will not go away for a VERY long time.

The only thing we can hope will not happen is that everybody then acts all hunky-dorey Hi-diddly-ho-neighbor! after their apology and even resubscribe to their channels, cause then they'll know that we'd are sheep and they'll take a crack at React World again, which is pretty much a given because of that sweet Robert DeNiro/moolah/green crack: the only thing they care about when making content on YouTube.

A fantastic example of this is Sky Williams' tweet about their apology:

This whole ""shitstorm"" was completely unjustified and based on a painfully premature (and already refuted) assumption, that Fine Bros. are going to ""trademark"" and ""own"" all ""reactions"", which is retarded beyond belief. The concept of React World was in fact very interesting, because it could easily (and legally) bring e.g. a new language versions of popular ""React"" shows to the world - and the concept of ""licensing"" or ""franchising"" is nothing new (or evil). And the idea to trademark the word ""React"" is nothing ""terrible"" as well; it's just the ""brand"" name, not the general idea or genre of ""reacting"" (similar to Apple's trademark of ""Apple"" - e.g. as a company name, not a fruit). Well done, people, well done. Dumb, paranoid and vicious - the internet at its best. \#facepalm",2/3/2016,t3,43sdch

They brought all the shit on themselves.

Their 'reaction world' idea may have worked, if they hadn't been total cunts about it. (and had made their cut of the proceeds a bit more reasonable)

It's quite right that the internet went nuts about it. They don't own the format. The way the internet works is if you make the best reaction videos, then you will be the best known channel for them. Fair enough you shouldn't be able to blatantly copy a successful show, but reaction videos are so generic. You sit people down and ask them what they think of something. It's been done for decades, and they didn't start it. The only thing they should be able to trademark is their specific graphics etc.  But no, no, they had to go fucking people over for making any kind of video involving a reaction.

Them getting a trademark for the word react could set a precedent of YouTubers and companies trademarking half the dictionary, and that's exactly what the internet doesn't need.",2/4/2016,t1,czmurpt
3439,czpdpz0,t3_43sdch,1454712410,Xarrgon,1,0,0,0,1,"Please, tell me more about all those DMCAs, that Fine Bros. released on YouTube mere hours after they introduced the React World. Please, tell me more about all those popular reactions videos taken down and whole channels deleted in just a few days. And also about the dark age of Fine Bros. ""reaction"" monopoly - at least until brave Reddit decided to bring the justice..

I've read forums and Reddit, I know they claimed a couple of videos in the past - two main keywords being ""a couple"" (e.g. just a few, including a video with 8 views - and they apologized for it in their first ""Update"") and ""in the past"" (e.g. they didn't need all those new ""evil"" trademarks and React World - it simply wouldn't change anything). So no, they were not ""cunts"" about it - but people were cunts about it. Thousands and thousands of ""cunts"" that cried, shouted, harassed and bullied them for the whole week basically for no reason.

As I've already mentioned (and as they mentioned as well), getting a trademark wouldn't change anything. You can't ""trademark"" a general idea of ""reacting"" (or ""singing"" or ""breathing""). It would only help them to protect their brand (e.g. a channel name and titles of their shows - which is completely fine and understandable). It's like when Apple copyrighting the name ""Apple TV"" didn't (and could not) set any precedent to ban people from selling apples or TVs or having to pay them royalties. It's really as simple as that.",2/5/2016,t1,czngzr8

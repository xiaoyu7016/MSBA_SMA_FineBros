Still, I think them being upset and siccing their fanbase onto the Ellen show is different from claiming videos infringe on their trademark, which would require *much* more similarity than Ellen's segment.

Based on their first video, I imagine their goal was to license their branding to people that wanted to make videos using their ""Kids React"" or other formats and logos and music etc, promote those videos on their main channel which has tons of subscribers, and then there would be money coming into them from the licensing, money going to the creator of the video in the other country (possibly helping them get other projects off the ground via exposure and income), and their fans would have more videos of people reacting to things, which they seem to like and are sometimes pretty interesting.

The trademark thing also doesn't really make sense. Making a video that features people reacting to another video and calling it ""____ react"" is just the most straightforward way to describe what's happening in the video.

I mean, to use the example they did, it's one thing for Burger King to trademark ""Burger King"". But imagine if they just trademarked ""burger"".

But, because their branding is different, and their menu items are not exact duplicates, they are not infringing. 

The Finebros, however, are saying -- as the evidence from their takedowns suggest -- that if you use *any* element of their videos there is infringement.

A franchise would be licensing those exact, unique elements and duplicating them. The way McDonald's allows franchise owners to take those exact elements of their restaurant and duplicate them. There is a contract, and there are also rules that would keep you from deviating too far from the license so as not to dilute the brand.

So, to take the Finebros and the hamburger stand as an example. What the Finebros are doing with ""react"" (or attempting to before the backlash) in terms of if they were running a fast food restaurant is saying: ""Okay, we are a hamburger place and we are franchising our branding and our menu to others. Wait, is that *another* hamburger place? Well that can't stand! They're selling hamburgers but *we're* selling hamburgers! That's infringement!"" 

If Finebros were McDonald's they would be suing Burger King because they would claim that Burger King is using their ""format"" in that they have a similar menu and a similar style of service.",1/31/2016,t1,czil1he

Didn't think so.

OTOH- let's say there's a couple of wannbe YouTube producers in France. They see the ReactWorld offer and and do a ReactElders in France with FBE branding. They get mentioned by the FineBros, their site gets linked and they get a thousands of hits in the first few days instead of 13.
How is that not a good ting for all participants.

OTOH if that same group of french folks did something very similar - that doesn't use FBE branding and stubbornly builds up their channel over a longer time- that's fine too. It's not like FBE could stop them (as long as they don't use logos that are too similar etc...).

Unfortunately, the way they conveyed their intended expansion seemed quite alarming because they were so explicit in how they needed to trademark elements of their show to protect their brand. It suggested that they were trying to trademark the basic idea of a reaction video. Even though they aren't copyrighting the idea of reaction videos (they can't, and it wasn't even an idea they came up with) and even though they claim they aren't doing this so they can chase after other reaction video producers on Youtube, the fact is that they have filed a trademark claim for the word ""React"". The fact is they have taken down others' reaction videos on Youtube. Allegedly, they even managed to take down a growing ""Seniors React"" series *before* they launched their ""Elders React"" series. And they encouraged their fan base to attack the Ellen show for doing a segment on kids reacting to the technology of yesterday, despite it not exactly copying their format of show.

So, the concept is decent at its core, fledgling producers can get a hand in creation and distribution from the Fine Bros and the Fine Bros get their monetary cut. However, the way they tried to sell the idea as flashy buzzwords and how they just need to protect themselves so they were justified in trademarking the word ""react"" seemed a little too similar to the kind of PR-spun BS regularly spoonfed by big telecomm corps and the patent trolling we've seen before. Plus, they will be setting a precedent on Youtube that suggests that once large enough, a content producer can trademark their concept (how are you going to market a reaction video without using any form of the word react in your title?) and take down any meaningful competition.",1/31/2016,t1,cziqy4z

455,czim34x,t3_43igca,1454253612,anonilicious,3,0,0,0,3,"It was Christmas Day at the Fine Bros. house. As the sun shined a beam through their frosty window, the anticipation and curiosity surrounding the gifts under the tree bubbled up in their mind.

""I wonder what Mom got us,"" Benny asked himself. He knew the Fine family's been having money troubles, ever since their father left to focus on his work overseas.

""I don't know,"" Rafi replied, ""But it better be good!"" This was the first time in Rafi's life he wasn't absolutely certain he would get what he asked for. The mere possibility left him livid.

The two made their way downstairs. Benny, haphazardly, in long excited leaps; and Rafi, slowly, sneering downwards from the top of the steps at his older brother's deceptively childish demeanor.

Underneath the Christmas tree laid just 2 presents - locked firmly in the sights of their respective recipients. Benny was the first to reach his, clutching it in his hands with a smile that could melt frost from the very windows lighting it. It was barely 10 seconds before he'd gotten the wrapping paper loose.

Inside, was a brand new hat. Hand-knitted by his mother, and a card - adorned with only 6 words. ""I love you, Merry Christmas - Mom"" He put it on right away, the stitches stretching desperately over his balding head. ""What'd you get, Rafi?""

""I don't know yet, give me the box!"" he snarled. As Benny handed him the box, he noticed it felt rather light. Rafi noticed the same, much to his dismay. He tore off the wrapping paper as if delivering some kind of punishment to his gift.

""This isn't Monopoly! What is this!?"" he threw it across the room, shouting. ""I SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR MONOPOLY, *MOM* - WHERE IS IT!?""

But there was no response.

But there was no response.

""MOM!"" Rafi said.

Benny turned to Rafi, and said, ""Hey, yeah. I can't wait to thank Mom!"" He arose in a flash, saying, ""Mom!"" In his onsie, he eagerly trotted like a horse out the living room.

The hallway floor rumbled like a deep drum, with each trotting footstep.

Rafi stormed along the same path. Through his gnashed teeth, he said, ""If I don't get Monopoly, I'm going *to* SUE!""

Benny ran up the stairs, saying, ""Rafi! Race ya?!"" He darted up, with a great smirk. The smirk turned to surprise and anguish, as he tried to take three steps at the halfway point. His hands broke the fall, but not enough to prevent his forehead from bouncing.

Rafi froze behind Benny, and the house was silent, except for the grandfather clock ticking in the lonely livingroom.

Benny's voice cracked, as his face scrunched up. A tear dripped down his nose, and fell to the stair. His quiet sustained sob made Rafi cringe.

""Wait."" Rafi said, as he stepped past Benny. He climbed into his bunk bed, and pulled out his phone from under his pillow. He came back to Benny, and held the phone out.

Benny stared with more tears dripping down his sorrowful face. ""You're not going to tell Mom, are you?""

With a sly grin, Rafi said, ""Nope. Oh no."" He brought the phone closer to himself, and tapped the screen to examine his newest photo. ""Mom!""

Benny said, ""Wait!""

Rafi ran up the stairs, and knocked on his Mrs. Fine's door at the top of the stairs, on the right.

The door opened, and a well endowed woman in a red silk negligee, red stockings, and black high heels. Wiping the sleep from her eyes, she yawned, and then said, ""What's the commotion?""

Rafi said, ""Check this out! Stupid brains, over there, tripped. Look at his reaction. What a baby, eh?""

She slapped him on the shoulder, and said, ""What are you doing? He's just a baby."" As she stormed past him, her face began to scrunch up, as she felt the pain of her youngest son.

Rafi said, ""Mom!""

""O-o-oh. How's my poor baby? You must be in so much pain."" She lifted up his torso, and sat down. She then let him lean back between her legs.

""Yes, mommy.""

Rafi said, ""Mom!""

She whipped her face around, and said in a scolding way, ""What is it?""

""Mom! He's twenty years old. He's old enough to be taking care of himself. You can't keep sheltering himself like that.""

""This is my house. I know what's best for my children. Go to you room!""

Rafi stomped into his bedroom, and slammed the door.

She turned her attention back to Benny, and rubbed his head in long slow strokes. ""Sh-sh-sh-sh.""

When Benny had stopped crying, he put his thumb his mouth. His diaphragm and lungs were still gasping for air through his nose.

Mrs. Fine said, with brave smile, ""Let's get you into the livingroom, while I make *you* some hot cocoa!""

Benny pulled his thumb out, and chuckled.

She rubbed his shoulder, and they took their time to safely navigate the stairs.

She parked her son, on the couch, but before heading into the kitchen, she took a moment to turn on the Christmas lights. On the way out of the livingroom, she winked at her son.

Benny sat on the sofa, and looked around the room. The Christmas tree had many of its plastic branches missing, but he loved the smell of it. Whether it was vinyl or PVC, he could not tell, but it always gave him a sense of love and security.

Occasionally, he glanced at his reflection in grandfather clock. He wondered why his mother had given him this hat. Did she think that he was ugly, and just wanted him to cover his hair? Was she afraid that he might catch a chill in the sixty degree weather? Maybe she just liked to knit. He could not figure it out.

""Here you go,"" she said, in a sing-song tone. ""Remember to blow it. It's hot.""

""Yes, Mommy."" He held the cup to his face, and steam warmed his nose and his forehead. Memories of Christmas past danced in his head, and he had forgotten the painful moment on the stairs.

She flicked off her heels, and curled up beside him. She stared in delight, not uttering a word.

Every few sips, he turned and smiled at her. Half way through the cup, he breathed deeply, and reached up to wipe the perspiration off of his forehead. After he pushed his thumb under the hat to remove it, he froze. He turned, and said, ""Mom?""

""Yes, sweetie?""

""Why did you give me this hat?"" still with his thumb under his hat.

She chuckled, and stroked his thigh. ""Just because.""

He nodded, and smiled. He removed his thumb and continued with his hot chocolate.

""Would you like more?""

""No, thanks.""

""Mommy had a long night. She's going to get some Jack Daniels."" She rose up from the couch, and made her way to the kitchen in her stocking feet.

When she had disappeared, Benny put the mug down, and fanned his face with his hand. He also pulled at the collar of his onsie, and he could feel hot air flowing out.

Mrs. Fine came back from the kitchen with a one and a half litre beer mug. Barry looked at it. It was only three quarters full, but he could see that the entire brim was already wet.

She curled up on the sofa again.

""Mom?""

""Um hmm?"" She stared at him wide eyed, but with a much more serious demeanor.

""Am I ugly?""

She burst out laughing, and then rubbed his head and hat. She gave him a side hug, and leaned into him. ""You're so funny...""

She put the mug to her lips, and her throat gulped a couple more times like that of a drunken sailor.

After a few more quiet moments, she put the mug down on the end table, and then stood up. ""It's time for me to give your brother a piece of my mind.""

At a moderate pace, she stepped up the stairs. Without knocking, she opened Rafi & Benny's door. ""Now, look here, buster. You have no right to be talking to your mom like that!""

He looked up from the LEGO death star, that he was building, and threw Darth Vader at her. ""Get out, Mom! Don't you know how to knock?!""

""I'll knock whenever I please. This my house. You have no right to be treating your mom, who happens to be a **single* mom, like that. Check your male privilege!""

Rafi stared back, and then started to slowly shake his head. In a voice that was so low that it was almost a growl, he said, ""You hate me.""

She gasped, and held her chest. ""I do not!""

""Well, guess what? I HATE YOU, TOO!"" He could see the pain in her eyes, and he could see her effort to hide it, so he smiled.

She lifted her right hand, and stomped to him. She swung down towards his cheek, but Rafi deflected the blow. He twisted her wrist, and stood up.

She looked at him with wide eyes, and a dropped jaw.

He grabbed her face, and threw her down and back. She tried to step back to regain her balance, but it was too late. The back of her head smashed on the corner of the dresser.

Rafi stood on the balls of his feet, with his hands ready for a grapple, but nothing happened. All he heard was his own heart beating loudly, and his breath.

It happened so quickly. One moment, she had tried to slap him. The next, her body lay like a lifeless sack of hammers in a contorted position.

From downstairs, a whimpering voice said, ""Mom?""

Rafi quickly closed the door.

""Mommy?""

Rafi could hear Benny's voice coming closer. It must have been at the bottom of the stairs.

He stared at his mother, as he contemplated on how to get rid of it.. It had been so long since high school chemistry. He did not know which ones would dissolve her body.

""Mommy?"" Benny was at the half way point on the stairs.

Rafi looked at the open window. He decided against it, because the nieghbours across the street might see the body roll off the eave and gutter onto the grass.

""Mommy? Why aren't you answering?"" Benny was at the top of the stairs.

Rafi looked at the closet. The closet door could not shut, because there were too many clothes piled in it, with plastic containers, full of neglected toys.

The door knob turned, and the door moved, but Rafi was still leaning on it.

""Mom?""

Rafi calmly said, ""Benny?""

""Yes?""

""Wait. Okay?""

""Why?""

Rafi stood silent. He hated lying to Benny, so he thought carefully. ""I need a moment.""

'Is Mom okay?""

""Just wait.""

Rafi looked at the top bunk. He could not think of anything else. He stepped away from the door, and lifted her light body into that bed. He turned her body towards the wall, and covered her up.""

He then opened the door slowly only a little. He looked sternly into Benny's eyes, and sneaked through, while putting and extended index finger to his sealed lips.

In a normal volume, Benny said, ""What happened to--""

With a furrowed brow, Rafi gestured again. He gently held Benny's shoulder, and whispered, ""Come on.""

""But what about Mom?""

Rafi grasped Benny's collar, and jerked. He looked Benny in the eye, and said in a loud whisper, ""Come on!""

Matsuko says that the idol industry is one thing that shouldn't be unleashed unto the world, and that it would be utterly embarassing for Japan.

Okay, a question about etiquette here, because I sincerely do not know; I've never heard this point addressed. 

In the case that someone is a crossdresser but does not consider themselves to be trans per se, is it just like... a costume and persna they put on where they're playing a character of a different gender? So, for instance, it would be apt to refer to the character they're playing as the gender they're presenting themselves as, but when they're out of character you refer to them otherwise?

852,cziui7k,t3_43igca,1454269018,Calorie_Mate,3,0,0,0,3,"It's a good question, and not *that* easy to answer, because it's up to the individual and the type of crossdressing. 

You're generally right when it comes to drag. Most drag queens are an act by either gay or heterosexual men, without gender identification trouble(cis), and are adressed differently when in or out of costume. But it's also up to the individual. Some are adressed as ""she"" even outside of the costume, simply based on their preference and/or etiquette. And sometimes the ""act"" takes the upper hand, and is less of an act but the real thing instead. Like, that's who they are, and they found the niche to be what they want.

The latter is true in the case of Matsuko Deluxe for example. No one adresses her as ""he"" in Japan. The female pronoun simply became the standard, even though ""she"" is a gay man and not transgender. It works for her. Ru Paul on the other hand doesn't care if you call her ""he"" or ""she"", and she says that *“The only time you will ever see me in drag is when I am – what? Getting paid. It is my job.”* And then of course you have people who simply don't believe the ""female clothes | Male clothes"" thing and dress however they want. I believe Eddie Izzard belongs to that tribe, but I'm not so sure right now.

So yeah, the only way to *really* know, is to ask (or probably safer) to observe. Don't worry though, *nobody* will get mad at you for not knowing how a guy in drag wants to be adressed. 

Well 'nobody' might not be true, since there are of course  always people who shout at anything that they deem wrong or ""offensive."" Like *""I had a panic attack because someone in class adressed Caitlyn Jenner as 'he'!!""* ... [Seriously!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JI01BjmSLA) But 90% of the time, these people are not part of it anway, and nobody really takes them that seriously.

Not sure how common this is though (I notice you did allude to this by saying that ""most drag queens"" aren't), but videos I've seen of drag performers explaining what their show is seem to give the impression that it's both about 'getting in touch with your feminine side' and 'creating a new persona'.

Also, what's with asterisks? A number of months ago I know a few people who said you should never, ever, write 'trans' without a * next to it, but now I don't see anyone do it and nobody ever explained it to me. Was it supposed to stand in for sexual/gender?",1/31/2016,t1,cziui7k

They cling to their *format* being *unique* because their insecurity rightly says that there's nothing original about what they're doing, that it's been done thousand times previously in other medium such as TV, radio, as well as the same medium on youtube. They're in deep denial about their lack of originality, so everyone else are 'misinterpreting' what they're saying. In their minds they're unique and everything resembling an interview format targeted toward kids/elders/teens have to fly under their flag, because they convinced themselves it's the format that's unique to them.

I get home,  and call him over with a flat look on my face. I keep my tone level as I tell him, ""here son, I bought you this"". His face is unmoving. He was born before the great inertion of 2016, but his school trains him well. He holds out his hands and takes the plainly wrapped box from my hands.    

  ""This present is most welcome"" he recites, one of the few FineBros approved responses licensed for non-commercial use by the public. His hands tear off the brown paper, slowly, steadily, without excitement. He sees the present now. A flicker of fear crossed his eyes, I could see it, I'm his father. I know what he's feeling. Shit shit, don't let them see son, don't... My sons eyes dart upwards. Shit, shit, I knew he'd like the present, he's reacting... He holds the case firmly as tears well up in his eyes. I knew I should have fucking got him something else, this is my fault, I knew how much he wanted this game... It's too late. He lets the smile spread across his face for the first time in 7 years. Its beautiful...     
  

The alarms go off, I make sure not to flinch, not to react. I know its only a matter of minutes now before he's taken.  
    


As I let my eyes glaze over and rest on a point safely above his head he drops to the floor and wraps his arms around my legs. ""I love you dad, thankyou, thankyou"" he sobs. I stay focused on that crease in the wallpaper. I can't be sent to the camps with him, his sister needs me. I control my breathing, in... out. In... out. The cameras on our living room ceiling whir as they zoom in, capturing the action for the FineBros and their audience. But not for me. I will not watch the video of them dragging him away, I will not watch his mother react as she watches it. I will not watch the video of her reacting to it either. I refuse to, none of them. They will take my son, but they will not earn the ad revenue from me reacting to it, no. When I react, it won't be on video. They won't have time to drag me away...",1/31/2016,t1,cziid34

The fanbase has revolted, shit on them and Reddit has gone bananas. The core concept they're explaining (including the copyrighting, if it *is* as they explain) is fine and legit. But their double standards about shooting down others and not allowing fair use are coming home to roost.

You got it completely backward. 

They dont care if some people dont want to be on the show, there will be hundreds more audition for their show for $$$ and couple minutes of internet fame.

Losing subscriptions (and potential viewers / fanbase) are huge because of their direct sponsors. No company will put down their money on a production with Losing subscriptions, low view#, thumbs down, negative PR.

They spent many years and hours to build up subscribers. Now they are losing like 10,000 subscribers per day. If you think losing 10k subscibers per day is small drop in a bucket you are completely off. They are worried and panicked. Thats why they posted damage control video there.

They meet folks in similar circumstances, read books about how entrepreneurs are fundamentally different from other people and share certain traits, and get into echo-chambers with their fellow entrepreneurs to discuss themselves and their shared traits. 

They quickly become insufferable. They believe they are so elite that they can advise anyone about any topic, no matter how far removed from their knowledge base; they look down on anyone who doesn't worship and exemplify the buzzwords they have tattooed on themselves (innovative, leader, individualistic); they believe they are never wrong. They balk at the idea of following any tried-and-true business protocols or following any advice because they only see the weaknesses or failures in other people's efforts and only see the strengths and success in their own. 

It's one thing to believe wholeheartedly in your product/startup as you need that belief to bring it to market, but past the entrepreneurial/startup phase, that monomaniacal self-assurance quickly becomes myopic self-aggrandizement. When they succeed at something, it's because they are so visionary; when they fail, it is because other people don't share their vision. All other facts, variables, or possibilities are ignored.

These twerps' lawyers, who of course push as hard as they can to say ""yes"" to the rich kiddie entrepreneurs' ideas, told them they could get away with this, and so they tried to do it. Now they're furious because the rest of us -- who aren't entrepreneurs like them, so we wouldn't understand -- are getting in the way of their ""vision."" I won't even ascribe malice to them: I don't think they're sitting off-camera twirling their mustaches thinking how they can use IP law to create a monopoly; I think they were so obsessed with their idea that they never fully understood the IP law or considered how the public would react to their shitty idea. In their minds, it was a great idea, so they never considered alternate viewpoints. 

This is what happened to Grooveshark. A fantastic entrepreneurial startup that went completely (and tragically) awry because the guy who started it could not unsubscribe from the romantic ""could do no wrong"" visionary image he had of himself. IP laws were in the way of his vision, and thus were flawed, so he pushed past them the same way he would push past the objections of a venture capitalist who didn't automatically see the genius in his vision -- unfortunately, that strategy doesn't work in every instance.

They all seem to be under the impression that the Fine Bros. are only after blatant ripoffs that copy the graphics/overall look and feel of the show, not general ""react"" videos. In fact, I think their original plan was to license *their* format to channels that wanted to use it (especially international channels). Think of it as Japan making their own version of Jeopardy—they'll need a license to use the show's music and style. 

**That being said**, what they say and what they *do* are two completely different things. And so far, they've done an incredibly shit job at whatever it is they're trying to do from a PR standpoint. Based on what I've seen, I think whatever plan they officially announced was all a ruse to let them go ballistic with the copyright flags and attempt to make the React video theirs. 

I'm just saying, don't assume every YouTuber is an asshole for immediately siding with them. Phil DeFranco seems pretty grounded and smart (though I haven't watched his content in years) and a lot of other YouTubers who seem to be good people are at least giving them the benefit of the doubt. I think they're misunderstanding the situation completely, but I don't want this to turn into a witch hunt for everyone who makes a living off of YouTube. 

EDIT:  (Some extra thoughts):  

Their MCN and/or bots are probably the ones flagging the really small channels' React videos.  I'm sure they have better things to do than flag videos all day. Perhaps their MCN is pushing them into being more aggressive with the brand?  

Even then... They told their viewers via Twitter to go after the Ellen show because they did a React segment.  I think that's pretty awful. One YouTuber I follow said it was justified because Ellen is ""old media"" and is somehow abusing her power.  Ithink that's a gigantic load of crap. If it's a situation where, as I said above, someone is blatantly ripping off their format than please, bring all the lawyers and Twitter armies you want. But it sounds like this wasn't the case with Ellen. 

I think the idea of licensing your brand to other channels could be very effective if done properly. Say they wanted to make a React channel for the French market and cater to French culture/viral videos, I think licensing their brand to someone and letting them manage the content is a genius idea.  But that's if it's only *their* show and not react videos in general. 

I think the guys should have taken a more personal approach to their apology/update video. Come out very open and honest and accept responsibility for the mistakes that happened and assure your audience that you're working with the appropriate parties to settle the matter.  Even if it was a third party like the MCN, it's still a good idea to accept responsibility. I know MCNs can be a huge pain to deal with, but it's still your signature on the contract. You signed with them knowing that they were going to take some control.

I think this is one of this situations where there is probably blood on both sides. It's just a major shit show that needs some (better) damage control. ",1/31/2016,t1,cziihq9

License their product so that they don't get burned in the long run because they've gained enough of a following to think that they're here to stay.

The react things is cool, until you look at how terrible the effect is on others, and what The Fine Bros can hold over peoples heads once they have the power. Their network has been making a huge deal out of fair use laws, and as a subsidiary of that network, it will effect the image of the youtubers in it, it has, and vice-versa.

The video reaction that they posted is only fanning the flames with it's scripted direction, and lack of seemingly genuine emotions. The body language displayed was unpleasant, as it wasn't the reaction that everyone was hoping for. The reaction everyone wants is for them to stop trying to get this trademark. The response reddit users have prepared is to fight back as hard as they feel like.

From the sound of it, that *is* what they're doing. Reddit's getting everything mixed up. The Ellen thing was over a year ago and has nothing to do with any of this.

Dear Fine Brothers, this backfire is going to take you down.

Here's my suggestion to you:

1. Apologize sincerely for all you just did

2. License all of your Trademarks and other Intellectual Property under Creative Common, FREE for non commercial use

3. Be lienient and flexible, if someone is making a few bucks, just let it be.  **A rising tide lifts all boats**

4. Monetize on **YOUR** channels and your channels only.

They have a community, congrats Fine Bros you have done a great job, really. Now you have a choice: you can kill it with your Corporate Greed, or you can foster it and make it grow, for Real. We can see your bullshit a few thousand miles away.

It's like unboxing videos, the format of them is almost always the same, but you can't copyright that.  They are attempting to control and monetize something they didn't actually create the concept of. They aren't protecting 'their' format, they are trying to squeeze out anyone who creates a react type video to have a monopoly on the genre, despite their insistence that is NOT what they are doing.

Should their shitty past behavior be used to state that, without a doubt, they are going to (and have the power to) prohibit anyone from ever making any sort of reaction videos ever? Probably not. They have clearly since developed a new way of responding to content that is similar to their own. Perhaps that ""new way"" includes the realization that trying to control reaction content on such a massive scale is not not only unfair to others, but out of their power.

They say right in their newest video that they want to 'work with people' who also want to create this type of content.  Well, people don't need their 'help', people can do whatever they want as long as it doesn't infringe on another person's copyright, which is exactly why they want the copy right in the first place, so on one else can make any videos of this type without them monetizing from it, which is bullshit. I'd say their past and current behaviour is a very good indicator of their intentions. But, they were hoping no one would catch on or figure it out so it would be put in place unnoticed, and there would be nothing anyone could do after but take down their 'infringing' videos.

The thing is, it isn't the video *per se* that is being watched, rather, it's the emotions (joy, sadness, frustration, anger, excitement...) of the person or persons watching the said video, seeing them *react* is part of the package. You might argue that it's a stupid thing *'Why the hell would I watch other people's faces watching xXx when I, just as well, could watch the video in question without seeing their stupid faces.'*

The psychological reasons (if we can call it that) that motivates this could vary but, essentially, there three main factors: **laughing** ***at/with*** **somebody else**, **lack of interaction with other people** *and* **curiosity**. 


I'll give you two examples: **The Red Wedding** from *Game of Thrones* and the overall *TeamFourStar's* **Dragon Ball Z Abridged series**. I'll give you two videos, one without reactions, the other with reactions/live audience:

*As always, spoilers ahead.*

[**The Red Wedding**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxvUuSzbMI)

[**The Red Wedding w/ reactions**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETokzErQvNI)

[**DBZ Abridged Episode 17**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxoT3A4qgRo)

[**DBZ Abridged Episode 17 w/ reactions from live audience**](https://youtu.be/0_Mzc-rl-Xg?t=33s)


It all depends on the person watching these. Some like to watch videos without other people's noises or reactions, others want to feel around with somebody or see/hear their reaction. 

Ultimately, it's like that question about movie theaters: *Why do people continue going to movie theaters when they could wait a couple of months and see the movie without noises around them on a DVD or BD?*",1/31/2016,t1,czih6bh

If the specific topic doesn't appeal to me I just don't watch the video.  I like seeing how kids interact with obsolete things that I enjoyed when I was their age.  I like seeing seniors interact with modern things that they are out of touch with.  I like seeing adults of differing outlooks with their take on whatever it is that is being discussed.  Its not like this was something thrilling to me nor am I being thoroughly entertained.  Its was just simply interesting and mildly entertaining that happens to be easily accessible and most importantly, its a great way to pass the time.  Its pointless now since after all of this got me to unsubscribe and stop watching their videos.  

I don't watch a lot of Let's plays, mainly just TFS plays because those guys are just funny together and I enjoy how they often make shit up as they go along in regards to creating back stories to the characters they create.

It's this whole copyright business that sucks.

To answer your question, no, this is not the web-age equivalent of seeing freaks on talk shows. Their react videos in particular do many different interesting things. One, they show different demographics reacting to things (for example elders reacting to video games or memes) which is interesting in itself. Two, they show many different reactions to the same content. Unlike poor quality reaction videos out there which just show a person barely reacting to someone else's content displayed in full in their video - a poor excuse to basically be an aggregate channel of other creators' stolen content - they heavily edit their channel to only show interesting reactions, and from many different people. It's a springboard to hear people give their differing opinions on this or that thing, or just to see how they instinctively react to things. In a way, it's social commentary.

Again, to reiterate, the content of the channel is not offensive or even bad. It has its value. The problem is entirely this copyright/trademark bullshit. It's actually turning people off The Fine Brothers who people liked previously.",1/31/2016,t1,czih6bh

https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/43gvp8/yet_another_youtuber_with_blocked_videos_from/czifcp1

**Elements of an Apology and How to Save Your Brand:**

1. **Start off with a brief account of the ongoing disaster.** The Fine Bros will make sure to carefully word this account to make themselves seem as innocent as possible. Remember, they will tell you that it was not their ""intention"" to have their video cause so much trouble. Notice the blame shift moving to the video and away from them.

2. **Describe the Fine brothers' roles** in the current nightmare. Use mitigating wording and sentence structures here to continue to muddle your responsibility. Talk about how hard this has been on you.

3. **Recognize the unfortunate ""confusion"" and ""misunderstanding"" that their announcement video caused.** Again, they've moved the fault to their video announcement, and not them. And they move the actual DAMAGE to ""confusion"" and ""misunderstanding"" and away from the fact that they have abused their trademark to take down countless people's react videos and that they are currently trademarking the word ""react"" itself. Redirect blame, redirect damage. For most people reading this, they will subconsciously associate the blame with the video, and the damage with their personal ""misunderstanding"". Propaganda, PR, whatever you want to call it, The Fine Bros will use it.

4. **Pretend to have sincerity.** The internet loves genuine people and genuine expressions. But The Fine Bros has never been genuine and can only fake sincerity. That's what allowed them to lie straight to our faces in their brief ""AMA"" where they told us they aren't going after react creators. Except now every other video in /r/video is from a new content creator sharing experiences of getting bullied by The Fine Bros' DMCA harassment.

5. **Talk about your long history of being awesome people and awesome content creators.** Obviously don't bring up your years of abuse of DMCA takedowns and your ongoing effort to trademark ""react"" itself.

6. **Thank your fans and supporters.** Really highlight how many wonderful, amazing, and caring people have come to your defense. This is what you hope people will focus on. Play on their sheepish group-think mentality of ""hey, look, they're talking about all the support they have, I probably support them too then!"" DO NOT allow people to actually rationally analyze what you did and what you are doing. What the Fine Bros did was trademark a bunch of react ""formats"", spent years shutting down content creators including the creator of seniors react (predating the Fine Bros' elders react). Do not let people rationally ask questions like, wait a second, what does Ellen's video have to do with your format? Why did you tell your fans to attack Ellen for stealing your format just because she talked to some kids? Do not let them ask hard questions and do analysis, LIE to them and appeal to their primal group-think. Lie to them because the bigger the lie the more believable you'll be. Straight up **LIE** and continue to say you do not take down other people react videos despite the torrent of people screaming in your face that you took down their channel. Ignore the people asking you about why you stole the idea of seniors react, threatened them with legal action, and then started making elders react.

6. **Pretend to be the good guy.** This can get a little tricky, there's a few ways to approach this. Maybe you can start from the ""employee"" angle. Talk about your staff, and apologize to THEM about the past few days. Make your staff the victim, talk about the hardships they've endured over this whole mess. This will end up making you look like a caring and empathetic boss (which will subconsciously win people over to your side). 

7. **Accept criticism (not really) but use it as a way to launch a misdirection.** For example, accept a MINOR criticism you've received like ""not being clear enough in our original video"" and then redirect to how YOU are the victim. For example, ""we fully accept ___ but we stand firmly against some of the racial slurs and even threats we've received in the past three days"". See how that works? You didn't accept responsibility for anything of substance, but you managed to use that as a segue into highlighting the bad things the critics are doing. This makes you the victim and makes you more sympathetic. You can also use your staff for this strategy: ""we accept responsibilities for something small, but our staff do not deserve the harassment and threats they've received... So please stand with us against online bullying!"" Leave out that last part.

8. **Group your critics together with racists.** The usual Youtube racists have been making anti-Semitic slurs at The Fine Bros. This is perfect for them. Despite these slurs being a tiny minority, GROUP EVERYONE TOGETHER WITH THEM. Do not address racism as a separate matter, intertwine racism with criticism. This will make any critics extremely unsympathetic (who wants to be associated with Anti-Semites?) and this will allow you to dodge criticisms of your actions. So when someone brings up the fact that you have years of history abusing your trademark to attack other people's content, find a way to work the racism angle your response. ""A lot of people have been saying untrue and frankly offensive things about us. I won't repeat the vitriol that was said about our ethnicity/religion but I will say this: Our intention is NOT to go after anyone's reaction videos. We just want to create a simple/fun/exciting/efficient/revolutionary/game-changing/insert-adj-here way for our fans from AROUND THE WORLD to make their own versions of our show!""

9. **ASK FOR FORGIVENESS AND SUPPORT!** You've spent your whole apology reframing this issue and using various tricks to misguide people. Now is the time to pull it all together into the final message. Ask for forgiveness, another chance, support, etc. If you did the previous steps correctly, this will the cherry on top of your PR manipulation sundae. Oh yea, and promise you'll try your darn hardest to never let down your wonderful magnificent fans again!

The Fine Bros' upcoming announcement/apology will follow a template not too different from this one. They are not going to offer a real heart felt apology because they are engulfed in corporatism. They have way too many corporate sponsors and TV affiliation to get away with giving a real apology. They will be force to use a carefully crafted and agenda-ridden ""apology"" that their lawyers and PR team gives them. I think that they are a little bit slow in coming out with this announcement/apology because a lot of people don't work on weekends and The Fine Bros have to get their apology approved by quite a few people.

**Important Edit: Here's The Fine Bros accusing Buzzfeed of stealing their narrowly defined and specific format:** https://twitter.com/thefinebros/status/572989392672837633

Remember guys, they only care about protecting their very narrow and specific format that they still refuse to define with words. That's why they also attacked and accused Ellen of stealing their format: https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/43e6a9/link_inside_in_2014_the_fine_bros_told_its/

Branding deals are hard to come by and give way more revenue than youtube ads. Getting this early on can give content creators desperately needed money to keep making content. No youtuber under 20k could ever dream of getting a branding deal, now they might.

- It didn't happen. Case closed.

- Ok, it did happen, but it happened under my predecessor. Go shout at him. Case closed.

- Ok, it did happen under my rule, but it only happened because of the state of the ministry, in which my predecessor left it in. Go shout at him. Case closed.

- *Something* did happen under my watch, and now we're launching an investigative committee to find out what happened. Their result is to be expected sometime within the nearest two or three electoral periods. The price of this committee will run into millions of tax money, and a few of the people on it are people who I owe favours for taking the fall for me before, and now are going to get a cushy, well paid job, where they don't have to do anything. It's not like they're supposed to find anything anyway. Case closed 

- Something bad happened, and the appropriate measures have been taken. The mid-high level public servant, who I always had a strained relationship  with, has been removed laterally to another department, and can expect a promotion within the next few years, just about when his kids are leaving for university. Case closed.

- Ok, something really bad happened, and you won't stop pestering me. It was this medium level political adviser, who did it alone and on his own initiative, out of misplaced loyalty of the country/party/company/whatever. He has been demoted to the party's central administration. Case closed.

- Ok, something very, very bad happened, and you ""journalists"" and ""voters"" won't stop pestering me. It was really my own senior political adviser, who did it alone on his own initiative, out of misplaced loyalty for the country/party/company/me/whatever. He has been suspended with full pay, and will be forced into retirement with full benefits at the end of his suspension. I will just have to live with the fact that my most trusted adviser did this ~~for~~ to me, while I continue to be a free man in a very powerful political position. Case closed.

- Ok, something did happen, and it was actually one of the party's politician's fault. This is my trusted protege and rising young star within the party, and he did it alone and on his own initiative. As a punishment, he will be backbenched for a few years within the party, and then given a ministerial position the next time we win the election. Case closed.

- Ok, something did happen and I might have been partially responsible for it. This is a sad thing, and coincidentally I happened to make money from it/gain political influence/favours with other powerful people because of this weird coincidence. Sadly, I'll now have to retire in shame on a full ministerial pension and have to do with the work I can get on company boards through the powerful friends I made while I had this office.

So much garbage that was infused in our data it affected our daily processes and whatnot.  Now the new stuff, creating new processes and workflows from the ground up with people who ... don't really know computers as much as they said they did on their resumes.  

The new software is very sophisticated but it's also very sensitive, so sometimes it feels like all day long we're encountering problems that could be fixed by going through the user defined options again.

Showing footage of people celebrating in the Palestinian territories after 9/11 is comparable to reaction videos that these guys are known for? How ?

I know it's easier to pile on the hate and outrage - but they created a specific format of having kids or old people or moms reacting to something, one after another, then reacting to it. It is a specific format that is not comparable in any way to what you posted.

I think that most people in their shoes would do the same. If people were creating reaction videos that was the exact same format, with interviews and all - that made them indistinguishable from their videos - I don't see why anyone wouldn't do what they did.

Big production companies do shit like this all of the time and everyone respects it. I don't know why everyone has to shit on people that aren't as large and established for doing the same. ",1/31/2016,t1,czikjpo

**1) They claim it's about the 'very rare' cases of somebody ripping off their format and style 1:1.**  
- First off, if these cases are so rare, why make such a big deal about it? Well obviously because it was initially not meant for these very rare cases. It's just a backpedal from claiming copyright on anything reacting in some form, especially videos of kids, elders, etc.  
- How did Ellen rip off their format 1:1 ? She clearly didn't, yet they felt they had to go after her. If they want their update video to stick, they have to address how that was a rip off in a 1:1 format. Because the fear of the internet is, that they will go after anyone that does some kind of react video or even just has 'react' in the video name.
Oh right, REACT is their brand. Next I make a brand of the word VIDEO.  If you pick this kinda generic name for your show it's your own fault. If I name my car manufacuring company CAR, it's kinda my own fault everybody else used the word CAR for their freaking cars.


**2) They say anyone can make react videos and say to basically trust them to not abuse their power**  
The only problem is, they are lying. They did take down videos. A lot. Over the years and after this controversy started too. They took down an 8 view video... Yes, they will now say that is their parent company Fullscreen doing that, possibly with an automated system. THIS DOES NOT MATTER AT ALL. If they don't anticipate their parent company taking videos down now, how could they even try to convince anyone the parent company will not take the trademark as a blank check to do what everybody fears. We have seen companies do this on YouTube for years now and stuff like this will make any appeals close to impossible.  

**3) They censored comments and opposing videos**  
This time I doubt they can blame Fullscreen for everything. They deleted YouTube and Facebook comments that point out the concern. They did not just delete the hater comments and death threats, but also a lot of very valid criticism  that point out this slippery slope and the exposure of their corporate doublespeak.


So FineBros,
unless you make an update video addressing the issues of

- **Going after Ellen for 'opening her own fast food restaurant and not opening an unlicensed burger king'**  

- **You and your company being take down happy for dozens of cases of fair use and how they are not going to get worse after REACT WORLD and all trademarks are established**  

- **You censoring legitimate criticism and comments that exposed your corporate marketing phrasing for what it really means**  

you won't appease the masses.
As it stands right now, it sure looks like you want to monetize the react videos that use your exact format through REACT WORLD and aim to takedown any competing videos with descriptive titles like 'Kids react to ...' or even just the action of having people react.",1/31/2016,t3,43igca

Their feelings towards ellen may have changed from a year ago. And it was unimportant because they tweeted, they didn't make a video about it, or email them, or block the video, or tell everyone to boycott ellen.

2. I'm sure most creators put their whole video in youtube's filter. Any case of take down would have been from audio visual matches. Not from people making similar react videos. That's people using their content and not providing enough difference for youtube to notice that the videos are any different. Copy pasting, which is a big issue, search facebook freebooting, similar stuff happens on youtube.

2. Fair use on reddit is a grey area that everyone is pushing the boundary, you can't blame them for trying to fight it. Look up jacksfilms debate with a youtube who reacts to whole content. the name ""kids react"" they made, that's understandable. It's like if someone started making a series called ""your grammar sucks"", copying it from jacksfilms, no one would complain if jacksfilms took down their video.

3. No Proof. Thinking the first few comments is spam isn't their fault. I've seen big youtubers admit they remove one or two hate comments. Props to them for not removing any more. They don't need transparency in why they removed comments, it's their channel. They could have disabled comments and lies if they wanted, there wouldn't have been any issue, but instead, they chose to listen to the hate and try to help people understand, because they know in their heart, what they are doing is good.

I've only seen them takedown videos with a copyright claim since the videos were reactions to their videos. Has there been any taken down by a trademark claim?

>They deleted YouTube and Facebook comments that point out the concern. 

Possibly shitty thing to do but unrelated to the validity of their trademark.

If there was a show on NBC called ""REACT"" and it was the same format as the Fine Bros videos it would be obvious that CBS couldn't make another show called ""REACT"" with an identical format. CBS could still make a show called ""The Reaction Room"" or something with a slightly different format and be in the clear.  There's been a ton of talent search shows on a variety of networks that are all essentially the same concept but obvious to the viewer that ""American Idol"" is different from ""The X Factor"" is different from ""The Voice"".

The only issue is whether ""REACT"" is distinctive enough from a generic or descriptive term. As of now the US Patent and Trademark Office has determined it is distinctive enough but obviously using ""REACT"" to trademark a show of ""reaction videos"" is thin ice. If they want to keep their trademark they would be wise to only apply it to ""the 'very rare' cases of somebody ripping off their format and style 1:1.""

I think reaction videos are boring as hell so I don't really care how this plays out. Fine Bros is a multimillion dollar corporation though and it makes sense for them to want to shut down ""somebody ripping off their format and style 1:1."" The only way to do that is to trademark their product, which as they've branded it is ""REACT"" and ""KIDS REACT"" and whatever else. They're in a delicate spot for picking a descriptive term in first place, but even if it's later cancelled as a business move it makes sense to try. Fairly obvious terms like ""flip phone"" and ""app"" were once trademarked. 

My guess is that eventually at least ""REACT"" will either be cancelled or strictly limited (such as you can't have another YouTube channel called -REACT- or REACT! or something). This whole thing will probably have been not worth it from the bad PR they've gotten, but who knows. Reaction videos aren't going to banned from YouTube.",1/31/2016,t1,czigod0

I sympathize with them. They're sticking to their guns and they know the jargon they've used isn't convincing anyone. They still believe it's a great idea because they probably live in a world where everyone agrees with them all the time.

2694,czil9c7,t3_43igca,1454251597,brickmack,9,0,0,0,9,"I stood on the bathroom counter, naked, with my back to the mirror, my hands spreading my ass cheeks so far open my anus actually felt strained. My legs held a wide stance, as I peered between them with my head between my knees, staring in awe at the upside-down reflection of my beautiful shit-winker. It was red, wrinkled, and seemingly limitless in depth. A few stray dingleberries were clinging to my long anal-pubes, a result of inadequate wiping. I loosened the grip of my right ass cheek, freeing one hand, then using it to circle the rim of my anus with my index finger in a somewhat tickling fashion. My asshole flexed from the sudden and titillative sensation, involuntary retracting in an almost winking gesture. I giggled, then farted. Expecting to see some kind of cartoon-like green fumes or brown bubble, but instead just watching my little pucker momentarily expand then reseal, returning to it's natural form.

""You're amazing,"" I whispered.

My wife sat on the nearby toilet, sobbing with her head in her hands. The recent infatuation with my own sphincter was putting a strain on our relationship, one that admittedly wasn't going to be quickly remedied by any form therapy. This was pure love, not just some cheap form of fleeting lust or passing human desire. This was a burning, deep, enchanting devotion from the soul. My asshole was the most beautiful thing I've ever encountered. My wife realized this, and couldn't cope with her recent feelings of worthlessness. Anything we once had was gone - my divine sphincter taking its place.

""I remember when you used to talk me like that,"" she sobbed. ""Look at me like that.""

I slowly inserted my index finger inside of my gorgeous turd canal, moaning as my cock began to stiffen, shit residue staining my penetrating digit. My breathing intensified, as my body clenched with orgasmic delight - a perversion so divine.

""How can you flaunt your mistress in front of me like this, gratify yourself like this? How?"" she cried desperately. Her voice cracked as her fading beauty-now meaningless to me-seemed to die a little more. She meant nothing to me. My bewitching brown oval consuming my soul with a desire like no other.
Lusting for just one kiss with my poop-chute, I pulled my finger from my ass, tasting it with sensual delight. The sour, pungent taste of fecal matter brought my cock to a complete and raging hard-on - pulsating with every excited heartbeat. Smacking my lips, I savored the grotesque turd juice, as if sampling a fine wine. The pre-cum now dripping with erotic anticipation from my pounding ramrod.

""Hold my ass-cheeks open while I jack off,"" I ordered my wife. ""I want to see my asshole when I cum.""

""No! I won't do it!"" she screamed in complete distress, the hurt in her voice matching the desperate tears streaming down her face. ""This isn't right! It's not fucking right! I'm your wife!""

Ignoring her, I reinserted my index finger up my pooper, while furiously masturbating with my other hand. Angels sang as I began building toward orgasm, moans of enchanting ecstasy echoing off the bathroom walls. My eyes crossed as I screamed with absolute pleasure, I was close, so fucking close.

""Stop it! Stop it!"" my wife pleaded.

My strokes became more defined, faster, harder. I cried out in desperation. Almost there...

""Jesus! Fucking stop it! This is our home! Ours!"" she cried. ""How can you...?""

A tremendous warmth filled me, as my cock spit white gravy in immense, systematic spurts. I continued fingering my asshole, stimulating my prostrate, enhancing the sexual euphoria, as my steaming cock shot thick man juice across the bathroom, clinging in long, mucilaginous strands to the wall. My vision blurred, feeling the full force of the powerful quake. The light faded as I fell into world of unconsciousness, basking in the comfort of my newfound love, and the endless pleasure of an absolute anal infatuation.",1/31/2016,t1,czijtvn

-I have strong opinions about the FineBros
-English is my second language
-I am exhausted

Look at it this way; Remember RWJ's old videos, which largely consisted of him delivering commentary on/reacting to viral videos? Yeah, he got a lot of flak for those videos despite their popularity. Why? Because people recognized that, to some degree, he was using other peoples' content, thus other peoples' creative efforts, as a basis for his own product. The same went for Perez Hilton and his ilk. Making content that follows for format of ""Oh hey something happened, this is my opinion on that thing!"" has always been received somewhat critically, even going back as far as Beavis and Butthead. But I contend that these formats were respectable, on some level: they consisted either of normal people reacting to extraordinary circumstances (""I'm Ray William Johnson and Check out this Walrus,"" to ""I'm Perez Hilton and Some Famous Guy Just Died, even to something as profound and grim as a video of people watching the 9/11 terror attacks), OR extraordinary people reacting to ordinary circumstances (""Blind Man's Reacting to Seeing for the First Time, to ""I'm Kim Kardashian and this is how I feel about ___""). So, to bring it back around to Finebros; their videos are so much worse than RWJ's videos or Perez Hilton's glorified wordpress. Why? Because they don't actually ""Create"" ANYTHING. They don't even have to offer creative/insightful/funny OPINIONS. All they have ever been are glorified middlemen; they take videos/media that SOMEONE ELSE made, that SOCIETY decided were entertaining, and then they listened to what OTHER PEOPLE had to say about that media. And they managed to disguise their own greed and laziness behind thumbnails of cute children and endearing elders.

 To have the gall to accept any payment at all for what they do is gross. To have the gall to DEMAND payment is laughable, and shameful, and there is no opposing argument that an honest and intelligent human being can possibly accept. Not when the FineBros have already made it painfully clear that they   a) have no respect for the community's creative talent & freedom, AND b) have no creative talent of their own to offer. They want to steal from people. They want to control people. They've made known what they are willing to take away, and there is nothing they can offer to make that alright, in my eyes. They were once a benign part of a collective whole, an outcropping of a specific kind of content where such content had no place, but did no harm. Now they seek to not only grow, but to grow without reason or rhyme beyond the innate desire to grow, and do not suffer anything to stand against them. They were once a funny lump beneath the internet's skin; now, indisputably, they are cancer. ",1/31/2016,t3,43igca

They are a classic example of the monkey with his hand stuck in the hole in the tree because he won't let go of the nut. They WANT to be free of this fiasco, but they WANT to have the trademarks too. In a very interesting way they are becoming the poster-child target of all the trademark/patent hatred so very many of us have towards the idiotic policies of the USPTO letting big companies take a lang-grab on generic terms and ideas. Right here in this video the Fine Bros actually ""touch the third rail"" on this issue but don't really seem to get that they have:
 
""Hey, we're not saying we're the only people who can make and sell hamburgers! Of course anyone anywhere can make a burger! It's the free market man, you misunderstood us! Make and sell all the burgers you want! It's just like we're McDonald's and we're requiring anyone who wants to make and sell Big Macs to have a franchise license from us!""
 
Yeah, actually no. Not really. Not really very close at all. You guys started a business making fast food and called it ""Fast Food"" and (incredibly!) the USPTO was willing to give you a trademark on this. (Something like ""Kids React"" should absolutely NEVER be trademarkable in my humble opinion. They should have been forced to at LEAST make it ""Fine Bros Kids React"" to be covered. Every parent with a cell phone is making videos when their ""Kids React"" to something. It's INSANE that the USPTO would let this go in the first place.
 
But that wasn't enough. Now you guys went after ""React"" by itself!
 
So YES, you're right that McDonald's is being fair by demanding no one sell ""Big Macs"" and that Burger King can sell all the Whoppers they want. However, you're being disngenuious by side-stepping the fact that your product is just called a ""burger"" and now you want a trademark on the term ""Burger"" which is naturally going to bring this riot down on your heads from massive universe of everyone who makes burgers.
 
But here you are, holding that nut in your hand... You actually already *were* given a trademark on the term ""Cheese Burger"" by the USPTO office already (i.e., ""Kids React"") so you think you can get a trademark on the term ""Burger"" too (i.e., ""React"" by itself.) So that delicious delicious nut is right there in your hand, but you just can't get it out of the tree, but you keep hoping you can and you can't let it go.
 
You fell into a blunder here. The USPTO is so completely broken that it will allow you to do things that it shouldn't. So if you're greedy you may legally be permitted to do something that makes you a pariah. Just because your lawyers can get something done doesn't mean it's right or even a good business idea.

I get home, and call him over with a flat look on my face. I keep my tone level as I tell him, ""here son, I bought you this"". His face is unmoving. He was born before the great inertion of 2016, but his school trains him well. He holds out his hands and takes the plainly wrapped box from my hands.  
  

""This present is most welcome"" he recites, one of the few FineBros approved responses licensed for non-commercial use by the public. His hands tear off the brown paper, slowly, steadily, without excitement. He sees the present now. A flicker of fear crossed his eyes, I could see it, I'm his father. I know what he's feeling. Shit shit, don't let them see son, don't... My sons eyes dart upwards. Shit, shit, I knew he'd like the present, he's reacting... He holds the case firmly as tears well up in his eyes. I knew I should have fucking got him something else, this is my fault, I knew how much he wanted this game... It's too late. He lets the smile spread across his face for the first time in 7 years. Its beautiful...  
  

The alarms go off, I make sure not to flinch, not to react. I know its only a matter of minutes now before he's taken.  
  

As I let my eyes glaze over and rest on a point safely above his head he drops to the floor and wraps his arms around my legs. ""I love you dad, thankyou, thankyou"" he sobs. I stay focused on that crease in the wallpaper. I can't be sent to the camps with him, his sister needs me. I control my breathing, in... out. In... out. The cameras on our living room ceiling whir as they zoom in, capturing the action for the FineBros and their audience. But not for me. I will not watch the video of them dragging him away, I will not watch his mother react as she watches it. I will not watch the video of her reacting to it either. I refuse to, none of them.

#YOU HEAR ME FINE BROTHERS?!

I won't believe a single thing you douche bags spout on *any* format until I see a complete show of submission in the form of full legal relinquishment or claimed control over ALL react trademarks and pending ones save for trademarks containing your company name itself. 

This includes the Teens react and Elderly react trademarks they unsuspectingly slipped by the community as well. Which they immediately employed in abusing abs bullying anyone too small to defend themselves.

You don't get to regurgitate a bunch of hollow promises when you have broken them long before voicing them 'à la politician'.  You have a track record of DMCA claim abuse, a long history of using your lawyer buddies to bully anyone deemed too weak to defend themselves, and deserve NO trust or respect for any words that come out of your mouths until you PROVE your commitment with the actions above.

You don't get to trademark a genre that is an intrinsic part of the home video subculture, especially when you were no where near the first people to do it.  It's akin to trademarking the use of rice with curry, then suing all the curry shops across the planet.  Fuck your greed and presumptuous claims to these trademarks you in NO WAY have a right to.

#PERIOD.

#No compromise, no half way.  File the petitions needed to withdraw all current and pending trademark claims or copyrights related or containing the words ""react""....or watch your company die in the greed induced fire you have wrought upon yourself.

They are trying to limit creativity by taking something generic that has existed forever, and making it theirs alone. It's not even something special, amazing or creative. It's just reactions ffs. People react to stuff every day. It's as basic as it can get. The fact that they can't see why that is wrong, just makes me wonder if they are as stupid as they look. 

We shouldn't just blame them though. I can't even begin to understand how anyone can look at their request for this trademark or copyright or whatever you want to call it, and then approve it. This will cover so many innocent videos and content from tons of people who have never heard of these guys, until they get taken down by request.

Personally I had never heard of them and have yet to watch a single one of their videos other than the 'announcement'. But because of all this, I now know who they are and I hate them with all my heart.

Seemed innocent enough at the time... then they launched the NGE.

Overnight it seemed, those 250k subscribers left.

Now, the funny thing is, SWG eventually grew to a better game (albeit different) than the original.... but they never recovered from that one single shake in confidence and inevitably, a number of years later, shut the game down.

Some things are psychological.. it gets into your head. They'll be looking into the camera from now on, worried they're going to get 80,000 downvotes again, scared to engage and embrace their audience, feeling that 14 million of their fans hate and despise them..

It's not. Copyright applies to a work. Examples of a 'work' include a book, a movie, a television show. In America at least (probably elsewhere too, because of the international treaties around copyright law) all works are considered copyrighted as soon as they're created.

> Where are the lines of what you can copyright and what not?

Here we get to the heart of the matter. Most of the time it's pretty straightforward. Copyright originally protected books. Over time the law has changed to include most stuff you might call 'art' or 'creative' in some way as copyrightable: TV, movies, Youtube videos. What the Fine Bros are claiming copyright on is the ""format"" of a series of webisodes they create. 

The law here is unclear, inconsistent, and not very well known. I don't know enough myself. I can only guess  'format' would be the sort of thing that lets you have different versions of a show like, say, Big Brother in different countries. The 'format' for Big Brother might include things like: people live in a house having no contact with the outside world, they get filmed the whole time, and once a week a person gets voted out of the house by the audience; the winner then gets picked from the last 2 remaining housemates at a big finale filmed live. 

The issue is that I have no idea which of those elements could be considered copyrightable and which couldn't. Alternatively, it might just be the combination of all those elements together that makes a ""format"" copyrightable. I really don't know. Neither, to be honest, do pretty much any of the redditors who've commented on this issue to date.",1/31/2016,t1,czijs1r

> Alternatively, it might just be the combination of all those elements together that makes a ""format""

 For me the term 'format' implies that there is a certain concept behind it (like you said, e.g. Big Brother; People getting locked up in some sort of container, no contact to the outside world etc.). Now, I haven't seen a single video of them in a long time. Is there a certain, a specific concept behind those videos that's not vague in any form and doesn't change (significantly) with every video?

 Let's say I'm producing a new TV show called Big Sister. The concept behind the show would be putting people in a container, no contact to the outside world and filming them (you see where this is going). Naturally I would expect Endemol (the creator of Big Brother) to tell me that it's not okay to make a show like that, since it's exactly the same concept as theirs for Big Brother. 

 If that's how it works, then the whole problem with this story would be that they're (intentionally?) not precise enough about what their 'format' is and, with their description regarding their 'format', that they potentially could target everyone uploading/showing any form of reaction video (no matter the structure/makeup), right?",1/31/2016,t1,czikf9l

That would sound like the idea to me. Interesting floating tidbit of information I found about formats and copyright:

[Germany: No Copyright Protection for TV Show Formats](http://merlin.obs.coe.int/iris/2003/8/article31.en.html)
The news article says that a ""tv format"" is ""a concept comprising all the characteristic features of a show which, although the content is different, are sufficient to characterise subsequent shows in such a way that the public can recognise immediately that they form part of a particular series. These include, for example, the title, logo, basic idea, length and structure of the programme, the way it is presented and recorded, signature tunes, etc"". It also says that German copyrigh law can't make this copyrightable. At least, it couldn't in 2003. Those international treaties will likely come into play here at some point...

> If that's how it works, then the whole problem with this story would be that they're (intentionally?) not precise enough about what their 'format' is and, with their description regarding their 'format', that they potentially could target everyone uploading/showing any form of reaction video (no matter the structure/makeup), right?

Ellen's has as much or more in common with ""Kids Say the Darndest Things"" than it does with a Fine Bros video.",1/31/2016,t3,43igca

----

Hi! 

As an independent journalist and media producer dabbling in many different genres I feel your venture ReactWorld is relevant to me, both as a content creator in new media and as a journalist reporting on and investigating this new media landscape. I have some questions that I'd be happy if you could clarify.


1. If I (the proverbial I in this case, whether I personally will make content now or in the future in that genre is something I have not decided yet) choose to not join ReactWorld, and make my own reaction videos instead, I would like to be able to do so without fear of infringing on your trademarks. But I'm unsure what exactly that entails. You have obviously trademarked the exact names of your recurring shows. And also in some contexts, the word ""react"" itself. Aren't those trademarks pretty generic? ""<group> react to <thing>"" isn't exactly an original brand the way Whooper or iPhone is. It looks to me like a content description, like ""hamburger"" or ""smartphone"". Could you explain to me why you think that is not the case?

2. You say in your last video, ""Just because we have a trademark, it doesn't mean we are going to be running around taking down videos."" As far as I can tell, that's not entirely true. A trademark that is not actively enforced by the trademark holder will lose it's legal standing. So you sort of have to. Can you therefore give me some examples of what I can and can not title my videos that are in the same genres as your shows? What I can write in descriptions, meta info on Youtube, et al, and what can I not?

3. I have from time to time watched some videos of your various shows, and have done so now again to re-familiarize myself with your content and presentation. I'm still not sure where the limits of what you call your format exactly are. I mean, showing a demographic focus group a thing, interviewing them about it, filming the viweing and the interviews and then editing it down to a coherent and viweable format doesn't exactly (as far as I can tell, I'm not a lawyer) reach threshold of originality as defined by copyright law in the US or most other countries. Your exact graphics and sound assets, as well as the specific content of every published video are of course already copyright protected. So anyone trying to copy your exact show should be struck down on that aspect anyway.  What else do you define as the format of your shows? Specific sequences of segments? Length of said segments? Specific recurring editing techniques? This may seem very obvious to you, but as an outsider trying make sense of it all, let me assure you, it's not.

4. If I do decide to join ReactWorld, how will you taking a cut of my revenue be a good value proposition for me? Will I save the equivalence in production costs? Will me being associated with your brand (and how specifically will this look?) or you promoting/aggregating my videos (and how exactly will that happen?) increase my traffic by as much? Can you increase my RPM? 


I have more questions, but I think I'll limit myself to those. You seem like you have your hands full at the moment.

The licensing is fine and dandy as long as it's FB's specific assets. That's the TV show parallel. As long as the other channels are left alone when they're not doing anything unreasonable. 

This isn't the only case where smaller creators are being attacked without good reason for sure, but it's still BS. To top everything off, YouTube doesn't bat an eye to it, reaction videos or not, which is getting ridiculous at this point.

If they were to keep to protecting their **series** of videos (the context of the trademarks) with their respective, individual ""____ React"" names, and then license that series out, that wouldn't be a problem. When fair use isn't taken seriously, that's a problem. When networks are allowed to throw false copyright claims at videos and get them taken down without YouTube even looking that way, that's a problem. Most of the problems here aren't specific to FB, but any video unfairly taken down by Fullscreen is part of that problem.

Brigading Ellen is a different problem. While I don't have respect toward them for it, and I think they're overstepping their trademark with it (or if you prefer, delusional if they think a judge would rule in their favour), I can't comment legally on the brigading.

Even if they change their minds later, their statements in these videos can be viewed as a remittance of any claims to reaction videos in general. Move on.

-There have been takedown requests all over YouTube, and YouTube's handling of claims has been horrible. Fullscreen has been issuing takedowns, but they're basically a PR company that handles things for YouTuber's who don't have the time or expertise to do it.

That's the point of a damage control video. If a singing show were to pop up out of the blue called American Singer and it shared similar similarities to American Idol it would be sued as soon as it started to gain momentum. Companies do it all the time. ""We have templates and free tools to those that pay/join us."" If you don't and try to make it they try to make it as difficult as possible.

They don't own the structure because they have not created it (unlike, say, the graphics). But if they use that structure with their name, music etc., it creates something callled a brand, which they do own.

All they have to do is just pretend like they're responding to the issue, and wait for the anger to tide over. They don't actually have to win back any viewers or repair any damage. They just have to bide their time, and in the meantime look like they're doing something. It doesn't really matter that they've lost close to a million subs at this point. They still have 14 million more and when all of this passes, they'll earn back another few hundred thousand at least within a few months.

That's the way it's always been, not just on the internet but out there in the real world as well. The biggest fuckups are resolved by waiting for attention to wane. Remember the (?l?) time when Reddit got rid of the positive/negative karma indicator? As I recall it, scored of Redditors threatened to boycott the website and leave for good. A couple of weeks later nobody really gave a shit. Remember last year when Ellen Pao was literally Hitler and scores of people were moving out and on to ""better sites like Voat""? Wow, Reddit's totally a barren wasteland now.

I'm usually the cynical dude who rolls his eyes at people getting overly dramatic about small shit on the internet, but in this case I think it's appropriate to say that this is one of the rare things worth fighting against.

Beyond the fact that Fine Bros are screwing a lot of people both in the present and future over, we have to look at this issue on a wider scale. The big thing here is that the Fine Bros are just a symptom of a much larger epidemic, and that's the fact that nobody gives a fuck about any form of regulation on the internet. Because nobody has really stood up to fight for this kind of equality online, we'll keep seeing more and more of these patent trolls coming up and pulling shit like this. Most of us aren't educated or qualified enough to lead the charge, but the least we could do is keep this at the forefront of our attention so that these motherfuckers don't sneakily get anything by us like they love to do.",1/31/2016,t3,43igca

The *only* thing you guys should be flipping out about is the vagueness of the application, that being just the word ""React"" and not a series of them for ""YouTubers React"", ""Teens React"", ""React World"", etc. Even then the trademark application in its original form will likely be shot down as too vague.",1/31/2016,t3,43igca
3604,czij2ix,t3_43igca,1454244749,royaldansk,2,0,0,0,2,"To be fair to the people who don't finish Jon Paula's video, it's difficult to trust any Youtuber who has any large-but-not-quite-large-enough following. 

The small ones that got stepped on, sure, they may have a personal stake in making the videos but they have the underdog/victim thing going for them.

The slightly bigger ones though, there's probably every chance they don't want to burn any bridges or their Youtube dreams are still intact. They have more to lose than the ones who have complained, but without a large enough following to cushion them from saying something bad.

This Jon Paula guy wouldn't want to destroy any possibility of perhaps someday being approached by Fullscreen or other similar content management network. Or stop any Fullscreen member Youtuber from collaborating with him in the future, or make other Youtubers who don't want to be associated with a Youtuber community-alienating opinion distance themselves from him. These smaller channels need the cross-promotion, and they won't want to shake the boat.

No one's going to speak up until they've become the victim of this and are at risk of losing what they've built. 

And the larger ones may be part of the same network, or just friends with these guys, or have already trademarked things but just haven't brought any attention to it. The (still) successful ones probably do think ""Yes, of course, protect your content, I'd do the same thing! I wouldn't hurt other smaller people, so benefit of the doubt to you guys!"" I can believe the Fine Bros don't intend to hurt other creators. But hey, good intentions.

So of course Jon Paula's going to defend them and of course 8Bit whatever is going to be angry at them. And of course the other large Youtubers are going to be mostly quiet. 

And who's to say none of these tiny Youtubers who got hit by takedowns wouldn't have tried to protect the format of whatever signature video they have, even if it wasn't this same way?

Jon Paula might get protective of this 5 minute thing format or his other format, maybe he's thought the issue through and is self-aware enough to admit that he'd do the same thing if he could. 

Because these guys on both sides are ""creators"" and creator types are understandably going to get angry at any perceived theft of their ideas. CinemaSins guy Jeremy was quite upset at his former friends at that place that does HonestTrailers when he thought they stole a format/idea he had. 

And of course Fullscreen only goes after the ones that seem helpless. The Youtubers who do ""X reacts to Y reacts to X"" videos are probably part of their network, or are big enough that Fullscreen may be wooing them or may have enough clout to defend themselves. 

But yeah, they better only ever use REACT when referring to their format and channel now, and not react or React. I mean, really, it's pre-genericized, and companies with genericized trademarks kind of mostly just suck it up at this point and just do an annoyed ""Correction, please, not legos, LEGO bricks or LEGO toys."" or something.

You know, sorry for the jumbled thought barrage, but the point is, everyone involved from the ""victims,"" the ""bad guys,"" and fellow Youtuber advocates taking either side are all trying to protect their ideas because they're creators, and they're all also thinking about monetizing their ideas. 

But I think there is that looming shadow of Fullscreen, Inc. that may be initiating takedowns the Fine Bros wouldn't have done if it were up to them, and they are possibly suspiciously only being done to small Youtubers or Youtubers who are not part of their network. ",1/31/2016,t1,cziihct

Well, maybe he wouldn't want to be a slave for one of those companies *now* but at some point, he may get big enough to be made a very attractive offer by a bigger production company than Jogwheel Productions, and that could become part of Fullscreen or be Fullscreen. 

But maybe not. But the point still stands that he wouldn't want to say he is against what the Fine Bros have done because as someone who runs a production company just like the Fine Brothers do, he wouldn't want to preempt himself from doing something similar in the future. And he wouldn't want to give other Youtubers reasons not to be a guest on any of his future shows.

But does anyone else feel the condescension dripping off their words?  I feel like the whole tone of that video was ""We're so annoyed that we even need to clarify this, fuck you people are so goddamn stupid."" When they really DID need to clarify.  While, yes, I took it to mean exactly how they meant it in the original video (basically a franchise option, not trying to own an entire genre that existed before their first react video), I can definitely see where people could and would make that assumption based on what was said.  
  
I just really feel like maybe they should've paid more attention to the tone and feel of their response.  It comes across combative, condescending, patronizing, and irritated even after they admit fault at the beginning.  I'm pretty sure we've all gotten really excited about something and misspoke in explaining it, but the mistake was not taking the time in the initial video to be absolutely explicit in their meaning.  This is the fucking internet.  You've got language barriers, idiots, and trolls that are just WAITING to intentionally misinterpret stuff like this to gain attention for themselves in mock outrage.

McDonald's doesn't say ""Go eat our burgers, now don't make anything similar to that."" They actually have a recipe, a list of ingredients and method of cooking, that they can compare to a list of other ingredients and other methods of cooking. This makes the process of finding out when one restaurant is infringing on McDonald's completely transparent for both parties, and keeps McDonald's from lawing against anyone and everyone who makes a burger.

The Fine Brothers have said ""Go watch our videos and don't make anything similar to that"" without providing a recipe. This means that finding out when you have infringed on their format is nigh impossible, because they have failed to give rigid guidelines that define their format. It's like arguing evolution with a creationist and trying to get them to define ""kinds"". They just give examples without any guidelines or solid definitions, meaning the actual definition shifts around all over the place as it is convenient for the creationist.

By following their instructions the format appears to be; a person(s) sitting in front of a laptop with a fairly plain/static background, and filming them as they watch/interact with something for the first time and interview them afterwards. If it's a video, whatever they are watching is seen in the top right corner of the screen, and on the bottom of the screen are pop ups that offer information and context to the viewers. They only have videos taken down that copy this format. 

I think maybe having other react video makers already on board and advertising their shows IN THE ANNOUNCEMENT might have helped explain it better, but it would not have stopped the backlash from going around and actively removing react videos from other channels.

This is what you pay for the use of branding and so on. The initial investment however is way higher in running a restaurant than making videos on the internet, but you still need some sort of investment to make the videos.

A restaurant needs a kitchen, while you need a camera to make a video. A restaurant needs a dining space while the video needs a computer to show the videos on and to edit. 

So the exact amount of money needed may be different but there is still a franchise fee for both Burger King and TFB, and also an initial investment for both. They both operate under a similar structure with franchise and franchisee, and are therefore, at least in my opinion, comparable.

Yes, that's the false claim that put the whole furore at its current white-hot level of intensity. They *did* claim a trademark on their ongoing series of webisodes, which means that other people need to use a name other than ""react"" for their series if they want to produce their own ongoing series of webisodes of people reacting to stuff. That's all that the trademark aspect means.

The part that the original flame-lighter for the outrage got confused over is that the Fine Bros also claimed copyright on a 'react format'. The Reddit submitter misread this to mean that the Fine Bros wanted to claim ownership of all reaction videos. What *actually* happened makes more sense if you read it as copyrighting the React(tm) format: a specific structure of elements unique to their webisode series, but which they've been very coy about describing in detail.

The Fine Bros' registered trademarks include: 'Teens React', 'Kids React', 'Elders React', 'Adults React', 'Parents React', and literally just 'React'. 'React' was filed in July 12, 2015 and approved January 13th 2016, to be published February 2, 2016.
The general ""use"" they've registered for React (and several other trademarks) is: IC 041. US 100 101 107. G & S: 
> Entertainment services, namely, providing an on-going series of programs and webisodes via the Internet in the field of observing and interviewing various groups of people.

If that isn't trademarking taken to the absolute extreme then I don't know what is. Maybe I'm missing something here but it looks like, in the crazy eventually that trademark somehow holds up, competitors who use the word 'react' and make a video featuring reaction by anyone to anything will be infringing on the Fine Bros trademark.

I understand the problem with making a show with the exact same name as Britain's Got Talent or American Idol, but the people who make these shows don't then say you can't use the word 'talent' in your rival talent show. At least I don't think they do. Because that would be absolutely insane. ",1/31/2016,t1,czik50j

Even though we don't know exactly what is in them, I think it is safe to assume that the one filed for the name REACT is for the youtube channel of the same name owned by TFB.

If this is the case, it only protects the word REACT in correlation to a channel or network name. Since this has never been done before we don't know for sure, but it is an educated guess.

This does not prohibit people from making a video or channel with the word react in it, but it will stop people from making a channel or network with the name REACT.

With regards to American Idol, I never said that. I asked you specifically if a concept that you created, was intentionally copied would you be angry. 

I don't work for 19 Entertainment, and I have not seen their trademark application so i really don't know what their exact concept is as defined by their application.

They equate it to a fast food restaurant and how certain menu items are exclusive to them.  Only...I see hamburgers at both McDonalds and Burger King...

I think they were drunk on success considering everything they have done in the last few years has gone quite well, so they're at that point were the next step you take you don't think about that much, because how can it go wrong? everything's great till now. I don't think they thought it through, and the fact that they're not really backtracking now is dissapointing. They're like ""Oh, we didn't explain it well, we're so sorry"". No, that's not the point, you didn't think of all the consecuences this had and you need to take a step back. Now every little youtuber out there who's had a copyright claim on a video is gonna go after you.

It's sad really, because I've been a subscriber for at least 3 years now and they don't seem like the douchy type of youtuber. They shouldn't let their own hunger for more destroy what they have.

I'd like to break down most of their copy right claims and why people like ""Seniors react"" and ""8-bit Eric"" got their videos removed. I understand how some people feel TFB stole ""Seniors React"" but in all reality they stole TFB format and just threw in old people in place of [kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDEQ6wmt8x0). Seniors react came out almost a year after the first kids react. 

Now to get into 8-bit Eric's [rant.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jfc_HE8dJ5k&feature=youtu.be) As you can see he feels deeply upset that he cannot post videos on Youtube and make money off of someone else's [content.](http://finalbosses.com/8-bit-eric-reacts-teens-react-sonic-unfair/) They might have actually let this go if he had asked for permission or wasn't racist and shedding a negative image on their brand. 

I've seen plenty of people who have worked with TFB react to their own videos. I personally don't get why people are so upset over the fact that they want to help people make money and teach them a correct format to do so. Even if TFB take 20% of a video almost all of their content is getting over a million views. This is great exposure for anyone trying to make money or establish a brand on Youtube.

I get what the Fine Bros are trying to do, as would any other successful company.  They're trying to protect themselves from people that would blatantly rip off their show format that have gotten them successful.  You've seen what happened with all the products that started with ""i"" in relation to Apple's iPhone and iPod.  For example, if some guy decided to round up 7 or 8 kids and have them react to a video, that is a blatant rip off of they're show Kids React.  Also last I checked, there are still millions of gamers on youtube and the whole premise of gaming channels is REACTION.  Are you telling me the Fine Bros are trying to kill gaming channels too? No, of course not.  

A lot of people are confused about the specific ""format"".  Just watch their videos.  Even in the one they just uploaded, you would have to copy the whole format, not just one part, which is what I assume everyone has misconceptions about.

However, I did read the description in the earlier and video and that tried to make it clear that's not what they were doing, which of course is true because it **would** technically be impossible to claim ownership of the whole genre from a legal standpoint. However, there are still some very worrying things here. 

1. They are claiming the name ""react"" by itself, now this could just mean that nobody can make a brand just called ""react"" by itself, but it could also mean that they could claim brand/channel that has react in the name. Which one is it? If I made, ""Adolescents react"" would that be sufficiently different? 

2. I saw their reaction to Ellen's segment on her show, that was not called react, was not an identical format, it just showed kids reacting and speaking to Ellen. The Fine bros basically went public saying they'd ripped them off. This is evidence that suggest they do believe they own the whole format, so makes it seem like they're lying.

3. There are plenty of legal precedents of cases where people have made a non-identical product, had success, and then been sued anyway since financially it made sense for that company to do so. For example, X-factor sued American Idol despite the different name and alteration of format because when Idol had success it was worth them attempting a case to claim in court that Idol was sufficiently similar to X-factor to infringe their intellectual property.  Now if they do it, why the hell would be trust the Fine bros not to do this if someone else has success with a reaction style format. They're claiming it's just about the franchise, but we've seen how these matters play out before and when lawyers see a chance at some money then the friendliness goes out the window.

4. A number of Youtubers have had stuff taken down already by people acting on behalf of the Fine bros, so we know they are already geared up and willing to get content removed. Given the precarious shitty system of Youtube copyright strikes now then this is obviously a scary situation, since almost none of these matters ever see court and Youtube just basically deals out rough justice on the basis of who is the more established partner. Really bad time to be doing this shit given the current atmosphere in the Youtube community.",1/31/2016,t3,43igca

YouTube is now, for millions of people,  a business and the FineBrothers have built themselves a nice little empire. So naturally they want to protect it. You all say it's confusing and vague, but it seems pretty clear to me. They trademarked their youtube channel, their logo, and their product. Just because they're the first people to do this doesn't make them evil. It makes them smart. Protect your assets. They make money off of their react videos, if someone is using the exact same format, they are potentially drawing away views which ultimately reduces their company's revenue. If this were any other business we'd all be crying out to sue the interloper to death. So they could go into the complete, 100% documented list of what constitutes copyright infringement, but why should they? It's pretty simple. Want to make a Pewdiepie style video? Go for it? Want to make a video where you react to a video of your friends or maybe even a compilation of other react videos? Why not? But if you want to make a video in which you record several people's reactions in an interview type format with snippets of facts about the content, the Fine Bros are already doing that exact same thing and making money from it that pays their and their staff's salaries and you are potentially drawing views away from them. Now what they are saying isn't that they want to take down your video. They're saying they want to partner with you, give you the backing you need to make your channel better, hopefully increase its popularity by adding the Fine Bros brand, and then you make money together. This isn't evil, it's not greed, it's simple franchising economics. If you thought, after introducing paid partnerships, that YouTube would be remain a place where we can all sing Kumbaya and paint rainbows, free from the realities of the outside world, you're just naive.

So, design elements, music, visual cues, etc etc. Which is totally understandable. It's their thing, they created it. If I want to make a react video, I just have to make sure it's formatted differently.

What IS slimey, however, is the fact that these two obnoxious tits have completely and utterly failed to control the situation, giving somewhat vague or poor explanations of their intentions and what is truly despicable, is that they are essentially saying ""this is the way it is"" and either deleting any form of commentary that goes against it. Granted, a lot of it is in no way constructive. Nobody wants thousands of comments saying ""you guys are greedy cunts"" when you are trying to have a conversation.

But other than the Ellen video war shit, I don't think they are doing anything THAT bad. I'll elaborate.

Let's talk about the one reason that still remains which makes me think they're not on my good side yet, they have already taken down videos because it resembles their ""format"", like the Ellen thing, that was horrible and wrong. But I don't think they're gonna do that again tho, with all of these massive hate they're receiving, they're gonna be threading really really lightly, it would be 100x times better to just be quiet and continue on making a lot of money off their videos. So I want an apology for the Ellen thing they did (and all the other videos they've taken down) and hopefully they won't take videos down again, except if another show has the SAME format, okay, let's talk about format, I think Reddit and Facebook are playing dumb when it comes to their ""format"" explanation, saying that it is too vague and that they wil take down just every reaction video. It's not every reaction video, take Ellen's reaction video, does it look like a Finebros video? No. Take an Elder's react video from the Finebros but swap the reactors for other elder people that have never been on camera and put it in Ellen's channel, that WILL make you think you're watching a Finebros video, and that's what they mean, just making another ""X reacts to Y"" with the same format, meaning it's basically a Finebros video with the people swapped. It's not hard to make a reaction video that doesn't resemble a Finebros video that much, and you know it, any other worth reaction video outside the Finebro's brand will obviously have another tone and feel.

Conclusion, **they're not gonna take down reaction videos**.

And with that out of the way, I actually think React World is a good idea. Hell yeah I want to see people from my country react to the new US's president, vs how peope from the eastern hemisphere react, I want to see people from all around the world react to the Global soccer championship finals, *and all of these with the quality of a Finebros's video*, this doesn't sound bad at all.

This is the hardest circlejerk i've seen like ever, all of r/videos is just one huge circlejerk against the finebrothers. Yes, I think there are so many problems and dangers with what they are doing. But, there is just such a circlejerk it's insane. If you don't think the FineBrothers and the metaphorical equivalent to Hitler, you get branded as a ""moron"" or ""being blind"". No one seems to think that even MAYBE they had at least SOME good intentions and just fucked up the presentation hard. 

Specifically addressing the video takedown thing. This is clearly 100% unacceptable. But, am I misunderstanding this, aren't these things automated, like how music video works? So they may very well not asked for a copyright strike takedown, but it was just done automatically. Not saying this is the fact, just asking for clarification from someone that knows more than me. 

For the thing of having a ""format"". Am I the only one who doesn't think this is absurd. Look at any of their videos, they clearly have a format to how they do their videos. If I was shown a video I could tell within 5 seconds if it was a Finebrothers video, cause they have a clear and consistent format, they really do...

To the thing of trademarking ""React"", I will make the caveat that I still see how this can cause tons of problems, and even within what it is is a HUGE problem.  But, just to clarify people realize you really can't TM ""reaction videos"". There are several people who own a trademark on ""React""(the most notable being a boardgames company), they are trademarking ""React"" within context of their show ""React"", just like they have a trademark on ""FineBrothersEntertainment"". Now, CLEARLY this is still a problem, and VERY subject to abuse, I just don't feel like everyone understands this fact. 

With the thing of them ""looking angry"" or whatever, I mean they are clearly frustrated and feel people missed the point. THIS DOES NOT MEAN WHAT I THINK THEY ARE DOING IS OKAY. But, this goes back to my point of circlejerking, people just keep making them out to be the antichrist; when they probably have honest however VERY MISGUIDED intentions. ""Everyone thinks their the good guy"", this goes to them too, however misguided and wrong on this they are, I really doubt they are trying to take over the internet with their fist of control. What happens when GradeAunderA or someone else makes a video saying exactly this, are you just going to downvote him to oblivion, or since he's the second coming of christ(don't get me wrong I actually like him a lot) are you going to circlejerk in the opposite direction(since it seems no one here can think for themselves).

You can make a reaction video like H3H3, he's completely different from Fine Bros but just like the Buzz feed video, they kind of made it. I know people won't agree with me. I just sort of understand them. Kind of going by the fast food allegory they made its like someone making a restaurant where people come to you in skates and using a similar logo as Sonic but call themselves Tails. That's what they are trying to prevent, or they want to create a franchise and just help others with that.

I know this hole thing has to do with bigger trademark issues and other problems with YouTube beyond thefinebros. Please lean back for a moment and think about what we are doing.

And of course they're going to trademark things such as ""Teens React"", etc. They made those formats and they made them HUGE. As per suit with the Burger King example: If you made the Whopper and it was doing very well, and someone else wanted to use the same name, you would want them to stop. Right? Why shouldn't they trademark? You can just call your react video something different.

Someone explain to me if I'm missing something, but I honestly am trying to see the problem here and I can't.

EDIT: I'd also like to add that React World isn't just for random people who want to make react videos. I think they originally saw it as a way to expand the genre. Some internet entrepreneur in Japan may want to do a Japanese version of the show, like ""React: Japan"" or something. They could use all the same graphics, all the same little pop-up information tabs, all the same phrased titles. React World, how I interpreted it, was meant for THAT.

The fact that the framework they are all working in (youtube) allows this to happen seems to be the problem as opposed to their ability to theoretically ummm ""react"" to the possible infringment. 


I don't really watch these videos ... or Ellen ... but if someone were doing something similar to me, especially if I was the one who made it huge, I might get annoyed that someone is using my stuff.

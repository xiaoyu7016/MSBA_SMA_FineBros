The only link they need is ""Reply"", which is absolutely visible under every comment, even when you're viewing your private messages. The comment box and the ""send"" button are also pretty visible when replying.

They were able to reply to comments, but didn't do anything else to solve the 10-minute gap, like validating their account with one of the millions of email addresses they control, or asking the mods what they could do about it. They didn't do it because they wanted to avoid reddit since they had no control over what people asked, so they moved to facebook.

Deer Meepster23,

Someone with actual experience doesn't need to validate their experiences using anonymous claims to internet strangers.

The only real validation you get is your words, and the implications of your words speaks volumes about you.

26,czgfcqh,t3_43490c,t1_czg2w5j,1454080308,Meepster23,4,0,0,0,4,"Just stop. Seriously.

Claiming that an account that is capable of figuring out how to modmail /r/IAmA to try and schedule an ama can't figure out how to modmail /r/videos if they are having issues submitting and/or follow basic instructions or ask for clarification if they don't understand them is patently ridiculous.

Then to go on to say that if I worked in IT I would understand is even worse. At this point I could bring up that your ""IT"" experience is made up of [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/310ryy/how_do_i_set_up_my_macbook_pro_for_python_dev/) 10 months ago to /r/learnprogramming where you ask how to install Python on your new Macbook. I could also say that I'm sure in your vast experience of 10 months after (presumably) managing to install Python on your laptop, that you are surely quite advanced and probably have job opportunities in development flying at you from every direction.

But both of those observations would be petty of me.

Instead, you're in hyper defensive mode here: posting memes to insult me, calling me a ""poor dear"", calling me a ""sad, strange little man"", digging through my post history for a nugget you can rib me with.

Tell me what's incorrect about that.  If you were actually experienced, you wouldn't need to validate your experiences to random strangers in an anonymous internet forum.  Nobody gives a shit here.  I'm the president.  Nobody cares.

Is it ironic that you're calling me a cocky ass, when you can't get through your day without telling others about your experience and how awesome you are?

Or is it a lack of self-awareness?

Here's what I see actually trademarked:

* Teens React [Registered - 4371580]
* Kids React [Registered- 4248447]
* Elders React [Registered - 4371581]
* Fine Brothers Entertainment
* Adults React
* Parents React
* React   ----   (Yes, seriously, just the word in a given context... I can't imagine this will hold)
* Celebrities React
* Do They Know It?
* Lyric Breakdown 
* People vs. Technology
* Try Not to Smile or Laugh

For the Kids/Teens/Elders React mark, the general explanation is:
IC 041. US 100 101 107. G & S: Entertainment services, namely, an on-going series of web site programs in the field of observing and interviewing [group]. FIRST USE: 20120524. FIRST USE IN COMMERCE: 20120524 

The registered items were filed in roughly 2012.

Now as to the general word ""React"" it was filed in July 12, 2015 and approved January 13th 2016, to be published February 2, 2016.  

The general ""use"" they've registered for React (and several other trademarks) is:
IC 041. US 100 101 107. G & S: Entertainment services, namely, providing an on-going series of programs and webisodes via the Internet in the field of observing and interviewing various groups of people.

You're not hearing me.

They are not claiming to be the gatekeepers to reaction videos.

They're claiming to be the gatekeepers to THEIR BRAND of reaction videos, owned by Fine Bros LLC or whatever the hell they call themselves.

Having said that, ""kids react"" isn't a very specific brand name, but the standards for trademark violation are higher than copyright violation.  You'd have to make a video that's practically the same thing, the same presentation, and called the same thing to get in trouble.  It'd be like if you made a soda pop called Doca Dola, put it in a red can, and used cursive lettering for the logo.  Coke doesn't own the concept of soda pop, or beverages in red cans, or even cursive lettering, but together they absolutely do.

You can totally make a video where you get a bunch of kids and have them react to things.  You just can't present it in a way to try and pass it off as their stuff... unless you sign up for their newfangled partnership program."

Copyright law generally protects the actual works (in this case, specific videos) themselves - including taking clips and sections of those works for remixing. Yes, you can *try* to use it for format and other elements (the most obvious one being stealing people's original characters) but it's very, very hard to copyright a general format/storyline. Personally - and again, IANAL - I can't see how they could go after anyone who wasn't trying really quite hard to mimic the exact style. The creative/non-obvious bar is just going to cut them off at the knees. 

Maybe I'm missing something - it's true that they DO seem to be trying to exert copyright... but I struggle to see how they're going to pull that one off in any context without the more stringent (and they are much more stringent) ability to thwack people for trademark abuse. This is actually why special characters (like mickey mouse) fall under both copyright *and* trademark - because my understanding is it's much easier to hit things with trademark than with copyright *when you're not actually using the specific artistic work*.

Copyright is ridiculous (at least in the US) because of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which implores companies like YouTube to respond to claims of copyright infringement by shooting first and asking questions later, lest they be held responsible for all content uploaded by all people to their servers.

It's NOT true that they're exerting COPYRIGHT here.  Nothing about that video changes their stance on copyright.  On TRADEMARK, they are opening up to people to partner with them and use their TRADEMARK.

Mickey Mouse is controversial because of how COPYRIGHT law changes keep extending the allowable life of copyright so that the original Mickey Mouse cartoon remains a COPYRIGHTED work.  That has zero impact on Disney's ability to assert TRADEMARK claims on Mickey Mouse as a brand under their control, that they are actively using.  Copyright law is NOT trademark law.  They are different bodies of law entirely, but because they cover similar topics, people conflate them and get really angry complaining about chilling effects, over a company doing something that doesn't harm anyone."

Even worse: the way trademark law works the Fine Brothers will almost be *mandated* to use legal services to defend their marks or risk them being lost. Now, this **isn't** as obsessive a need as it's sometimes percieved as - the EFF wrote up a lovely commentary on Ubuntu getting [excessive with it](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/trademark-law-does-not-require-companies-tirelessly-censor-internet) for example - a company doesn't need to enforce their trademark when they're the ones being talked about.

It depends. In trademark law there's this thing called ""nominative use"", which means you can use words in a descriptive sense, even if they're trademarked.

For example:

* a program selling itself as ""App McAwesome for Apple OS X"" would not need to license the names ""Apple"" or ""OS X"" because it's describing the app.

* if you sell a perfume with a 'love potion' scent , you would not infringe on the 'Love Potion' range of perfumes because you're using 'love potion' to describe the scent, not to trick people into thinking it was Love Potion-branded perfumes. (This was an actual trademark case, *Dessert Beauty Inc. v. Fox*.)

You increase your chances of winning a case if you a) prominently display your own trademark (so as to not confuse the viewer of the 'source' of your product - i.e. to prevent them from thinking it was an official React video) and b) display the word in question in a way that isn't prominent, or as prominent as your own trademark. In *Dessert Beauty*, the defendant's own brand was displayed much more prominently than the words ""love potion"", which were written in a plain serif font.

So, based on my understanding, if I made a video called ""MARKKB PRESENTS: these people react to grass growing"", I'd have a better chance than if I had titled it ""These People React: Grass Growing""."

""Teenagers Reactions"" would almost certainly be considered descriptive of videos of teenagers reacting, and probably doesn't even act as a trademark (i.e. an indication to consumers as to the source of the videos).  Fine Brothers would have to argue that these titles are likely to be confused with Teenagers Reactions, which would lead right into the argument that the trademark registrations are invalid as merely descriptive.

The reason why gaming channels/ let's play channels are popular is because of the level of rentention the viewers commit to when watching the video over the course of several videos, plus they are 100x easier to make than animated shorts, hence your point about the time input for monetary value output.

There are plenty of much more deadly things in the country/world. but for some reason people like to focus on guns because it tugs at the heart strings more than people killing themselves with alcohol or other drugs. And if you're going to come back with the number of gun deaths use the one that doesnt include suicides, because getting rid of guns wouldnt dstop suicides. South Korea is the prime example of this. 1/6 the gun ownership per capita of the UK. Second highest suicide rate per capita in the world. People there mostly kill themselves with pesticide.

If they do not, I will then modify my understanding of how racism is perceived in your country as per their differing account.

One the one hand, you have a pair of people that are clearly getting greedy when it comes to content, but I think there is a sliver of truth to them saying that they don't want to see the 'reaction' content deteriorate to any lower than it currently has. 

Now that we know GradeA *really* dislikes reaction channels, but he's said it's because he doesn't like the lack-of-effort content that they put out and that they are essentially stealing content from other YouTubers; the rules of reaction videos meaning there's nothing anyone can do. He's also said he likes the ""React To"" videos from TFB; could be that he might see this as a way to purge the shit content from YouTube and only have the quality reaction videos up there.

Now saying that - what's to say that the other reaction channels that are up there and actually do good work(or at least put a little effort into their content) don't deserve a little slice of the Fine Bros pie here. Will reaction YouTubers have to be licensed by Reaction World in order to put out the content that they're known for?

It's a difficult situation, and ultimately I think that TFB are in the wrong, wholly, but it has to be said that of all the reaction content out there that theirs is the best, and without it none of the other famous reaction channels would be even close to the amount of exposure they have right now. Do they deserve to say ""I made this, this is mine"" about the *genre*, no."

They aren't declaring that they own reaction videos as a whole, they're creating their own multi-channel network which others can license IF they want to be part of the TFB brand.

Whether this is a good / smart move on their part is beyond me. I'm no expert in YT and whether or not this is a savvy business decision. My gut tells me no, but that's not based on facts and I could very well be wrong. Also it's besides the point.

In short, the post title is misleading whether intentional or not and the briefest of searches turns up a pretty satisfactory summary.

EDIT: Okay, apparently it's more of a grey area and I'm not comfortable standing by my prior statement. Copyrighting the word ""react"" for entertainment purposes is pretty damn vague.

**Before anyone continue to defend what the Fine Bros are doing, they are just using PR talk to confuse you and pretend like they are ""franchising"" their specific brand. No, they are using React World to capture ALL react videos. They are already using their lawyers to bully others who make react videos. Here are some common responses defending the Fine Bros and why they are incorrect:**

----

**The Fine Bros are just branding their specific react videos, not all reaction videos**

1.	They have already legally trademarked Kids React, Teens React, and Elders React. They have been using their lawyers to threaten other channels who are attempting to make videos of kids react videos for years.
2.	Once React World launches, react videos of any demographic that falls under their media empire are their trademark. You can currently make “engineers react”, or “nurses react”, but once the Fine Bros successfully trademark all of these reaction types, they can use their lawyers to threaten you just like they currently threaten you for making kids react videos.
3.	They feel so entitled to their “format” that they think anything remotely similar to one of their “formats” is infringing on their intellectual property. They even threatened ELLEN for stealing their “format”. Ellen’s video is nothing like anything the Fine Bros do, she’s just showing kids on her show some old technology: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CMS9xnBRkc They made a facebook post calling Ellen thieves and bullies stealing and not respecting the Fine Bros. They’ve deleted that post but their tweet still exists (please screen cap it before they delete this too): https://twitter.com/thefinebros/status/513061415016341504
4.	In summary, the Fine Bros have always felt entitled to their unoriginal and stolen format. They say they won’t go after other content creators but they have been using their lawyers to shut down other content creators for years. They feel so entitled that they even considered that Ellen segment an infringement on their “format”. 

This should give you a VERY clear idea of what kind of people and what kind of motive the Fine Bros have.

**These guys are just licensing their shows to others, what’s the big deal?**

1.	That is their PR talk. Let’s look at their actions. They’ve used their leverage with Youtube to take down channels that were making kids react videos and seniors react videos. They’ve even threatened Ellen on Facebook and tried to use their fans to brigade Ellen for daring to produce this segment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CMS9xnBRkc

**They are just talking about their specific format, brand, etc. Not a big deal**

1.	They trademark every aspect of their “format” which already overlaps with what other reaction videos are. 

2. Once they use their fans to expand their trademark into every type of react video under the sun, then they can use their legal leverage to push you out. 

----

**The Fine Bros’ Strategy to trademark ALL react videos**

1.	Make no mistake about it, the Fine Bros fully intend on making ALL react videos theirs. And React World is how they will do it. The Fine Bros already trademarked kids react, teens react, elders react, etc. You cannot make a video of kids reacting to redbull and call it “kids react to Redbull”. Don’t believe me? Here are the Fine Bros’ own words: http://imgur.com/oik8CsA
2.	So how does this lead to them trademarking ALL react videos? Well once React World goes online, and people of all demographics make react videos and put them under Fine Bros’ empire, they will then trademark all of those new react titles the same way they did with Kids React. In other words, you can make “Nurses React” right now because they haven’t trademarked it, but once Nurses React becomes part of their empire through React World, they can then trademark it and stick their lawyers on you threatening you with legal action unless you take your videos down. THIS is how they intend on taking over ALL reaction videos. It’s underhanded, manipulative, and has enough steps in between for them the have hidden this in plain sight.
3.	If you still don’t believe this, then try making a kids react video right now and call it “kids react to ___”. YOU CAN’T. The Fine Bros have used their lawyers to threaten people who have done this already and they’ll do it to you. Do not believe them when they say they won’t prevent other people from making other “types” of reaction videos. They will only allow you to make your videos until they trademark your video’s name. They will do that through React World because they don’t need to put in any effort into actually making content anymore.

**What is The Fine Bros Afraid of?**

The Fine Bros' office employs over 40 people and have HUGE overheads. Beyond losing a few subscribers, what the Fine Bros are afraid of the most right now is **losing their sponsors**. They get very little money from Youtube ads compared to their sponsors. Here's them talking about their sponsors two years ago:

&gt;The company has created branded content for Universal Studios’ “A Million Ways to Die in the West,” AMC’s “Halt and Catch Fire,” Friskies cat food and Audible. “We have a series that is something brands can be organically integrated into,” Benny said.

&gt;The Fine Bros. are affiliated with YouTube multichannel network Fullscreen. They are repped by WME and managed by Max Benator.

http://variety.com/2014/digital/news/youtubes-fine-bros-launch-react-channel-1201266727/

They recently did a brand deal with Disney for Star Wars too.

They've taken on so many employees and have so much overhead cost that losing even a single sponsor means they are going to have to have **layoffs**. According to several former employees and a current employee working in their office (posting in previous threads), there is serious concern about potential layoffs coming because sponsors are worried about being associated with all the negativity.

So the Fine Bros have a lot on their hands. There will be lawsuits coming to challenge their ridiculous trademark on ""React"". There will be a lot of pissed off people flooding their sponsors' social media pages that may cost them sponsors. And they are dealing with serious office morale loss because of how tainted their ""brand"" is. The Fine Bros built their business on internet culture, they should have really known better than to think they could get away with this."

This was also good for the original content producers too; when people make up a satire of a show, or do a react video or do some other knock off, they often go to watch the original, too. This helps everyone. These guys, and others like them, are attempting to kill the golden goose to get a few quick eggs for themselves. 

Terrible. But what's even more insidious is their outright lies saying they won't be going after people who make react videos as long as it is not ""substantially similar"". Their legal department is not going to differentiate, at all.

By the way, the earliest GMO patents by them expired in 2014. Any farmer can cultivate these strains and reap their benefits without depending on the seed's developer as the sole seller. That's what also keeps biotech scientists improving on the strains, so that they can patent an ""enhanced 2.0 more efficient"" version that results more attractive to farmers.

Precisely -- they're doing something huge mega corporations already figured out years ago.

It's not new. It's not novel. It's not original. 

Yes, it's a travesty...and a moral injustice...and I would hope it was an *actual* unlawful act (idk anything about internet law, so mark that in your calendar that I'm apparently the first fucking person in the history of reddit who will admit that I'm neither a lawyer nor do I know shit about these laws)...and it's just a craptastic, dickheaded thing to do...

BUT, are they allowed to do it? Again, this is the interwebs so I'm not sure...but since when has ""not being the first one to do it"" prohibited someone from slapping a legal label on it and calling it theirs?

I know redditors love to get going on how they're ""violating rights"", or ""taking a shit all over other peoples opportunity and intellectual property""...but sorry, if what they're doing is legal, then they're just taking advantage of an opportunity that presented itself. The opportunity to make more money by hedging everyone else out of the game.

Not that I watched 'reaction videos' to begin with, but I agree with everyone in this thread saying that they're shitbags. I agree that their channel should be boycotted if you don't like what they're doing. I agree that someone well versed in the law should attempt to dismantle this silly, idiotic game they're playing. But just because it's happening on reddit's oh-so-sacred internet and not something done by Apple inc, or Nestle co, etc...doesn't necessarily mean that they're doing anything more than being a bag of dildos (which isn't illegal).

They are not saying they own reaction videos in anyway. They are saying they own the IP (Intellectual Property) of several formats of shows (so that includes things like the title, and the graphics and artwork and specific formats which refers to the layout of a show from start to end).

If you copy one of their videos exactly, minute for minute, word for word, using all their graphics and stuff. You're infringing on their rights. Thats what they are licensing.

Did no one pay attention to their very obvious example which was TV licensing. America/Britains Got Talented is a licensed format of a talent show. IT IS NOT CLAIMING RIGHTS TO ALL TALENT SHOWS EVER, OBVIOUSLY.

>NOTE: React World allows you to license some of FBE's most popular series (the specific elements and structure of each show), and use the trademarks. 

Ask yourself, what exactly is the ""specific"" structure of a kid's react, teen's react, or elders react video? The structure is just showing people a video and asking some questions. That's the whole react format! That's what they are trying to copyright despite shows like ""I Love The 80's"" doing the exact same thing way before them. There are kids react videos on youtube from at least as far back as 2007.

And notice their PR speak. They are ""allowing"" you to do something. This means there is something that you are NOT allowed to do.

Edit 3: **Even more censorship from the Fine Bros**

The Fine Bros posted a PR response in their comment section trying to claim they weren't copyrighting reaction videos. After getting a lot of backlash 3 hours ago, they deleted and REPOSTED the EXACT SAME comment in order to get rid of all the critical replies they received to their original comment. After about half an hour of leaving this reposted comment up, they started censoring the replies to the comment by hiding all but 3 of the replies. Finally, after getting even more backlash, they DELETED their own comment.

Proof:

After huge backlash, they've actually undeleted their older comment:

Legally it's generally proven impossible to protect a show concept. But names, phrases, graphics and, in some cases, specific game mechanics can be protected by variously, copyright, trademarks and patents.

Producers buy formats because a lot of the hard work has already been done - they basically get an instruction manual for making the show. They also get graphics and other various production stuff. As well as that there's the marketing benefit of building a show based on an already known format with the same branding - you get an assured audience.

This is kind of like franchising. They've built up an image, just like a company (McDonalds). They want to expand the brand, so they allow people to directly copy and expand the brand under their umbrella. I don't see why this is causing so many people to go nuts. Just like McDonalds don't own the rights to make burgers, FBE don't own the rights to reaction videos. What they do own the rights to is their branding, format and the IP/copyright that goes into assets and structures of the show.

>**A pyramid scheme is a business model that recruits members via a promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme, rather than supplying investments or sale of products or services.** As recruiting multiplies, it becomes quickly impossible, and most members are unable to profit; as such, pyramid schemes are unsustainable and often illegal.

- Recruits members via a promise of payments. (Free FBE license means you can get paid by YT for your videos, but FBE takes a share.)

- As recruiting multiplies, it quickly becomes impossible, and most members are unable to profit. (more people make more react vids, less people watch the individual videos but as millions are making them, the total views go up, all the while FBE is taking a cut. The individual Youtubers themselves will make virtually nothing.)

The only thing missing is ""active"" enrolling. But putting the FBE REACT logo into new places where it isn't popular, is passive enrolling. Also, having this copyright will allow them to claim money on videos that aren't theirs and don't have a license but too closely match their format. This would be forced enrollment.

Actual quotes from the video:

""join the Fine Bros Family""

""but what has been missing is how to expand Reacts further to communities across the world""

""be part of an exciting global community""

""www.FineBrosEnt.com/JOIN""

""no upfront fees, instead we're sharing revenue with you.""

""BRAND DEALS - PROMOTION""

""we implore everyone not to support those companies and channels"" - Describing people who make React videos without the REACT license.

""WITH reactworld, we're providing a way for people to make their own versions of our show (promoting it and their methods) and to do it WITH us, by licensing our formats and trademarks.""

""knowing that this was when we all stood together, changed the way things were done and created this first of a kind global community""

""So if you're interested in creating your own version of any of our REACT formats, which if you don't, then what is wrong with you?""

Yes, that last one is accurate.

This is exactly the kind of structure of language used by people creating cults. Mantras of togetherness, community and ESPECIALLY people outside the group being wrong or foul, insidious or not to be trusted. They are trying to indoctrinate their fans and turn them into recruiters. Not by telling them to recruit, but by making them want others they care about to be part of their community.

How can you still not get what a pyramid scheme is!?!?!? They're not paying people to recruit others, they're just sharing profits. It's like any kind of franchise.  [Watch this and maybe it'll finally sink in to your dense skull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGUywSX-cu8)."

This is how you think a pyramid scheme works.

Do you think people fall for that?

How it actually works is people get others to join in on an investment, an idea or concept. On something that is worthless. (FBE videos) They put work/effort/money into the concept but the person who benefits most is the person AT THE TOP.

Then the concept or idea or product radiates out and that's how the pyramid is formed. It's not done by LITERAL recruitment. It's done by having an idea/product/moneymaking scheme so great that people WANT to join just by hearing about it. You don't have to recruit for a good pyramid scheme. You just have to make people want to join. Get that into your dense skull."

I don't like the Fine Bros for their simple video format and how they got filthy rich (I'll admit, I'm fucking jealous, it's so easy)

I **had** respect for them though because they **were** smart about what they were doing. They had an easy way to make money and seemed very successful at it. Sure I didn't like their videos but it seems childish to judge someone's character off of the content they make.

People can subscribe to who they want. Not everyone on reddit is some 18 year old ""enlightened"" recent high school grad who thinks they have the world figured out because they hate Pewdiepie, Kids React to, and anything else that's ""popular"".

Now this, this is something that you definitely could judge someone's character off of. The things they are doing currently, right now. Absolutely calls for a reevaluation of their ""moral barometer"", but not because of what kind of business their in.

I was on one of the React shows for years (not specifying on the off chance they do see this and try to sue me for ""defamation of character"" or some other bullshit, makes it a little harder to know who this is), but can I just say how fucking HAPPY I am that the whole internet is realizing and calling them out on their bullshit?!?!

As i said, I USED to be on one of the React shows, and their contracts, ever since day one when they only had a few million subscribers, have always been incredibly strict and pretty ridiculous, but it was stuff I could live with, the main thing being you couldn't have a youtube channel.

But, unbelievably, their contracts got even crazier and I couldn't believe they actually wanted me to sign it. I basically told them to f*k off, that I wasn't signing my life away, which is what it felt like I wouldve been doing if I had signed it.

Dont get me wrong, i always loved going in to film and working with benny and rafi who were always so nice and cool...........BUT, when it comes to the business side of things, they don't give a shit about anybody but themselves and making a ton of money off of you and giving virtually none of that to you. But they make it seem, like they're doing here, that its all for YOU, and benefits YOU, when it really screws you over. I told everyone they'd be idiots for signing that contract (which I think I was really the only one to actually READ it, and not just blindly sign it), but they all did, and I think most of them are incredibly stupid for doing it.

At first, when I saw they basically wanted to own everything i ever did on the internet and sign my life away, and realized how as much as they said they cared about me, they really didn't especially when they werent willing to change any of the contract when they said theyd work with you on it if you were uncomfortable, and I decided it was not worth it and didn't like how i was being treated so walked away from being on their shows, I was pretty sad and heartbroken, and a little angry and bitter at them too.

But now, after all this coming out, I can say I'm really happy I'm no longer working with them and that I walked away and stood up for myself.

I can tell you no matter what they say and claim, they are ONLY doing this to make more money and take advantage of people and harass them, its not to create ""this ~awesome~ community.

Ahh this was pretty long and ranty, but I've been wanting to get this off my chest for a while...I considered making a youtube video about it pretty soon after it happened, but I cooled off and realized that wouldn't have been the best idea.

I'm no lawyer, nor do I have legal background, but telling someone that they can't have a YouTube channel seems like a Free Speech issue. Now (and not to defend these guys) did they mean a YouTube channel in which you did videos like theirs? Or a Youtube channel in general, where you post videos of you and your friends messing around, doing short films, etc.? Because if it's the former, I can sort of see it.... but if it's the latter... then that is, in my view, (and again I'M NOT A LAWYER, NOR DO I HAVE LEGAL BACKGROUND) a major violation of your free speech rights.

They make everyone sign NDAs. This is also what I hear from the PMs I've been getting from their former employees and even current employees.

But thank you for posting this publicly, and don't worry too much about them or get scared of them. To sue for defamation you have to prove damages. Good luck to them finding damages from this comment. And the ENTIRE INTERNET is against them. With lawyers coming out of the woodwork left and right offering free services to sue them. If you need to contact a lawyer, just PM me and I'll send their info to you (can't do this publicly because of personal info rule here). Defending a defamation lawsuit against the Fine Bros would have a lot of lawyers' attention.

But anyway, if it's okay with you, can I link this reply in my future replies? Most people are only just PMing me and not doing so publicly, you're one of the only ones doing so publicly. And people will inevitably question whether or not you were actually on the show, do you have any specific details you can share that can confirm you've at least been in their office or know the Fine brothers?

Unfortunately, quite a lot of great discussion was lost in the previous thread because of its removal, so I'll post a recap of what is going on:

The Fine Bros are claiming ""reaction"" videos as their intellectual property. If they succeed, then they can use youtube/google to remove any reaction video they want, much like how unauthorized movies and music videos are currently removed.

They want to do this so that anyone who wants to make reaction videos have to ""license"" their trademark. This is just a money grab. People are already making reaction videos, the Fine Bros just want them to start paying. In exchange, they throw in some nonsense ""resources"" in there to ""help"" you make reaction videos. As if people are currently having trouble recording people watching videos.

And when you do license with them you give up all kinds of rights:

>We’ve trademarked all our shows, which means they are legally protected

>We can revoke the license at any time.

>All brand integrations must run through FBE

>This is a purely digital license. You will not be able to turn the format into TV shows or be paid by third parties to create the content. If you are contacted for brand, distribution, merch or other opportunities related to the licensed format, FBE will take lead in those conversations


Basically, they want to control you and take money from you for making reaction videos, and they're using the power of Youtube/Google to do it. And now they are censoring any discussions about this on their video so that people don't find out. Shame on these two.

Edit: I should also add that reaction videos have existed on youtube since its inception. There are kids reaction videos on there that predate their channel by years. And TV shows from around the world have done the ""reaction"" format for decades. Any national morning news show like Good Morning America will have segments where hosts sit around a couch and watch/react to the latest funny/viral video. This format was not at all original and no one considered it ""stealing"" for using it. But if the Fine Bros want to claim it as copyrighted, then they themselves stole the reaction format from people who have done it before them.

Edit2: Want to get even more angry? Read their blog post on this telling you why you are a criminal for stealing their format for making reaction videos and why you should pay them. They also tell you that it's not enough you pay them, but they want to take full control over how you make money (towards to end of the post).

Notice the very careful language they use to try and make it seem like they are the good guys doing you a favor by helping you stop stealing ""their"" format. And how they are doing something great and noble by copyrighting their reaction format. A format that they didn't invent, that's been used on countless TV shows, that's been on youtube before they even uploaded their first video. Yes, that format now belongs to them, and you are a thief and criminal for stealing it if you make reaction videos. Lovely guys:

I've been watching their videos since they started and lately, they have had a serious entitlement attitude. In their lyric video for hotline bling, they were complaining about other content creators being unoriginal and stealing work. I thought that was pretty out-of-place and weird at first but didn't really think too much about it. But now I understand what they're really saying. They feel entitled to the very format of reaction videos. They think that just because they make reaction videos for kids/teens/etc, that those are now their trademark.

This plan of theirs to create React World just expands on this. Imagine people from all over the world licensing their trademark making ""engineers react"", ""Germans react"", etc. If they can claim ""kids react"" as their intellectual property, well, all those licensed react videos will also become their trademark. So in other words, if anyone creates any reaction video under their license, they can make the same copyright claim on them. This will ensure that anyone doing reaction videos outside of their empire gets axed.

And again, this doesn't even need to go through court. They don't need to sue anyone to get their video removed. They have a very intimate relationship with Youtube and they are among the top Youtubers that have the most parternship/leverage with Youtube."

Producer kept rescheduling the interview before finally telling me my interview was literally the next morning. Came in to the office door (their studios are right next door on the same office floor) and am told the interviewer is on the set side so I need to wait.

Waiting for like 20 minutes when one of the older guys from ""elders react"" comes in. He signs in (he also had a bunch of clothes with him, so I'm guessing they were filming several episodes that day) and sits down to wait. The bros walk through the office - he tries to wave at them and gets totally ignored. That really pissed me off.

After I had been in their waiting room for like 30 minutes, this woman comes in and tells me she's interviewing me today because the producer was running errands at the moment. One of the worst interviews I've ever had - barely asked me any job related questions, and talked a lot about herself. I was shocked when the interview ended because it felt like she hadn't actually asked me anything.

Then I left - walked out to the hallway - and heard some PA loudly arguing with someone (his girlfriend or boyfriend) on the phone.

Didn't get a job offer, but I never would have worked there after that.

- They make you fill out a long ass survey form before you even interview with them about why you love Fine Bros and what react series you like.


- They have a TV in their waiting room that plays nothing but React videos. Poor receptionist has to watch that shit all day.

2084,czfqtv3,t3_43490c,t3_43490c,1454023721,Cheating_b1tch,31,0,0,0,31,"Aside from their videos seeming to be trite (I've honestly never seen one except for this video and I don't intend to start now), this is hardly a new concept. They're basically co-opting the focus group concept. Sit people down, have them watch a piece of media, gauge their responses, ask questions, separate into marketing demographics and report the results. 

If they're copyrighting/trademarking their brand and materials I  hardly see anything wrong with it. It seems that they have every right to claim their specific set-up, logos, etc., without totally controlling every video where some asshole videos himself on webcam reacting to the new Star Wars trailer.

 I am also not a lawyer. 

However, as a regular moron consumer, I see two ethical pitfalls here. 

Number one: Are they gaining permission from content creators to feature their videos? If I were to create a viral video that then gained a bajillion views and was featured on their series, would I  receive any compensation? Would they need my permission before they monetized their reaction videos?

My guess is probably not. That seems awful ballsy to claim a copyright based on a product that relies on other content to sustain itself. I'm sure they claim fair use and maybe even that they bring more attention to the video in question by featuring it on their show, thus bringing the original creator more views and revenue, even though I strongly doubt they could prove that correlation. 

And how would they feel if I made a reaction video to one of their reaction videos? Would they be hunky dory with me claiming fair use, on the grounds of parody or criticism? My guess, again, is probably not. 

The second issue I see at hand is: Just how similar to their format does something need to be before youtube will act to take it down?

I tend to find reaction videos kind of stupid anyway (honestly, who cares what YOU think about such and such product that's being marketed...You're playing right into the hands of some corporation by doing their job for them), though I'll sometimes watch a fish out of water playful video. Recent ones that I can think of are the Korean girls trying American BBQ, or watching American porn. 

Those, I think, offer a nice slice of life. What it appears here is that these Fine Bros. guys have serialized this idea to make money off of content they didn't produce.

Since that's the case, just how much of their content can they claim to be original and thus owned by them? They certainly don't own the videos on which they comment. They don't own the test audience concept. And they don't own the act of reacting to things and posting it online. They merely own the right to their format, whatever that may be. 

To where do they see the parameters of that format extending?

There are a lot of questions about this. I'm always dubious of people who claim they want to ""revolutionize"" something. 

Like, other than monopolizing, what could be their reasoning for needing a trademark? Was there some competing service that was ripping them off? If they're claiming innocence and a want to change youtube entertainment for the better, then what prompted this?

Seems like a potential win/win for them and some content creators who join. They make extra money for doing basically nothing except extending what I assume is an already established brand, and it could help small channels grow their userbase quickly. In fact, a small channel could hypothetically join the program, use it to gain subscribers, then ditch the program once established and create content in their own format.

American Idol is a bad example, but let's look at The X-Factor: They have branding, intellectual property, materials, bumpers, host formats, merch, ETC. For both the UK and American series, which are licensed by different companies, cooperating. That's an example of the trademarking of a brand on TV. What the Fines are doing is making anything that has a passing similarity to their videos *theirs*, their format, their trademark. Getting the trademark to ""React ----"" or ""Try not to smile or laugh!"" is literally based on the format of the video being ""substantially similar"", which is a hand-wavey way of saying ""if it looks like a duck..."", and shooting a goose. That'd be the same as X-Factor calling out American Idol for having judges, people singing, and a voting system, yet none of the IP of the original. Which, I may add, FBE isn't going to give you!

It sounded to me like Fine Brothers Entertainment were simply pitching a business idea to interested Youtubers: ""want your videos to get likes and views? Split your revenue with us and we'll endorse you like so...."" And of course there would be legalities you'd have to follow if you jumped on board. I mean, they're lending their brand and name to you (sorta), so you'd have to produce content that would be a credit to them as well. Maybe it's a good deal, maybe it isn't; I haven't read the contract nor am I personally interested in FBE's offer....but why was everyone so up in arms? It seemed like people such as OP were trying to turn a molehill into a mountain. This announcement only affects people trying to grow YouTube channels, and only a small part of the demographic at that, right?

Then I read more. Here are my concerns as an everyday, internet-using citizen. One that does NOT have a YouTube channel, in fact.

I want to preface this by making a general statement: YouTube is where you go to post videos. I've never put a video on the internet, but if I wanted to, I'd put it up on YouTube. That's the platform on which I personally watch 99% of videos as well as the only one that I as an average Joe slightly understand operations-wise. I think my general situation is the same as a LOT of other redditors, and I think that this (my) demographic has a need to be concerned about what's going on here. FBE may be taking a stand on video trademark or copyright law that affects us too. Us YouTube consumers that may someday want to be casual content producers, knowing little to nothing about that law. Or us consumers that support and subscribe to certain channels who might be affected by this.

Plus this whole debate makes for some pretty good reading. So here are an average person's concerns:

1. FBE has the right to regulate legally videos (either by promotion or censorship) that contain what we lay-people would understand as their original content. I take 'original content' to be things like theme music, graphics or a specific layout that their company created specifically for the FB videos, which runs throughout their series. Fine. Good. They wouldn't be much of a business if they didn't protect that stuff, and I don't see anyone disagreeing. So why the censorship of MULTIPLE channels who use none of this content? Numerous examples have been listed before me as reference. I'm not pretending I don't see a similarity, but what I notice is a similarity of subject matter, not original content. And a laughably vague similarity at that: ""people see/hear something new or surprising. People have differing thoughts and feelings about it."" That's not an original idea, that's the human condition. You and I should be concerned about this because I bet a lot of your home videos center around relatives reacting to holidays, birthdays, surprises or shocks. If the Fine Brothers have a monopoly on showing this kind of thing, say goodbye to your dream of sharing that video where you told the kids you were going to Disneyland.

2. They're trademarking words and phrases. Since trademarking relates to brand identification, FBE is claiming that ""kids react"", ""teens react"" and ""elders react"" is their brand. Okayyyy....so that just means that you and I would have to be a little more clever in titling and describing our videos, right? Put ""My children react to the news of a Disneyland trip"" instead of ""Kids react to news of Disneyland trip"". That's annoying but workable. Personally I think they need to attach ""FB"" or ""FBE"" if it's brand recognition they're after. It's just those three phrases which are no-nos so far, but what about the pending trademark on ""react""? Guys, that's not a description or a flimsy vague title at best, that's a VERB. As in an action. An action people had been performing long before FB came about, and will be performing long after they're gone. We've been watching and recording in some form or another people's reactions to things ever since the practical joke was born. So this just plain doesn't make sense. How do you claim rights over this? Our concern here is that in using common words and phrases to title or describe our videos, we may be inviting legal trouble.

3. FBE is big. I mean seriously HUGE. They have employees and sponsors who dedicate workforces to upholding FBE's creative property. They have both in the past and are currently censoring YouTube channels and videos where some demographic they wish to trademark is reacting to something. Even little bitty channels like you and I might create. There are actually two concerns here:

A. Average guys you and I are now supposed to automatically know which common phrases and words (again-verbs? Really?) are forbidden. God help us if others start following suit.

B. If we are targeted for strikes, it's up to the accused to bring the burden of proof if we want our videos reinstated. Even if the strikes are blatant mistakes (like getting taken down for using ""react"" in a manner completely unrelated to human beings), do I have the time, energy, or maybe even money to pursue this? Do you? Most of us would probably just let it go, and a little bit more creativity and enjoyment will vanish from YouTube.

4. The last point I want to make concerns FBE asserting their trademark ""rights"" in arenas they completely don't belong to. The Fine Brothers brand exists as VIDEOS. On the INTERNET. A clearly defined medium and platform. Yet they've made tentative shoves at chastising other forms of media/entertainment. See posters above for information about them shaking their heads at the Ellen show for a segment she aired. This is alarming! Could they have a legal foothold in stopping other forms of popular entertainment or media from using this vague ""brand"" they're trying so hard to monopolize? What if I'm a radio dj who plays an old song and asks people to call in and comment on it? Does this affect me? Even if not legally, FB are certainly vocal about getting their large fan base to publicly disapprove! I could be slandered by a huge population for a supposed trademark violation stemming from nothing but two guys' lofty ideas about what makes ""original content"". 

In summary, what I would like to see is this: public clarification from the Fine Brothers. Tell the world explicitly what you'll be censoring them for. Is it just the use of those lyrics, or music, or graphics you guys made for your channel? Great! Then let us know and all of my concerns are totally unfounded. Is it only the use of those trademarked words and phrases? Dickish, but at least we know where we stand in terms of content. Or is it the actual physical video recording of human emotions that you're trying to monopolize? We need a clear picture here. At least TRY. Your ambiguity is starting to look more and more sinister in the eyes of a LOT of people. Do both us and yourselves and favor and give clear yes and no answers on what you're specifically going to attack, and what you're gain to leave alone.  "

I don't really watch TV so YouTube is one of my main sources for entertainment. I'll stumble across a channel that's doing well but is still fairly new so it's really charming, the creators connect with the audience and are running their channels out of love for the work, which really shows in the content. A few years later, they've grown too big for their boots, they run the channel like a corporation, they've started up countless new ""shows"" on the channel as well as sister channels, add too many new faces to these ""shows"" and they're clearly only in it for the internet fame and money. If you spread yourself too thin and think your ""brand"" is the most important thing about your YouTube career, inevitably the quality is going to suffer. FineBros, Game Grumps and whatever the hell Thug Notes is calling itself nowadays are just some of my most recent unsubscribes for this reason.

I really admire YouTubers who, after years of being active and popular have stayed true to what made them great in the first place, (never change, CGPGrey!) "

I used to watch captainsparklez' old videos till his videos started turning to shit. Last time I saw him he started merchandizing his own lunchboxes and promoting disney-infinity on his channel. And he's even been on youtubers react, so he's basically sold his soul at this point. *pukes*

It seems to happen to just about every channel now so I try not to get too attached when I find someone I like. I think so many of them are obsessed with the idea of operating their network just like TV that they entirely forget that people watch YouTube as a better alternative to TV; a place where this kind of corporate censorship and getting punched in the face with advertising isn't supposed to happen.

I also hate it when, if a YouTuber is funny in a natural setting (i.e. chatting/playing games/discussing events alone or with their friends on camera,) they get it into their heads that they're a 'comedian' and start promoting themselves as such without doing any of the work that actual comedians do. As a huge comedy nerd, I think there's a big difference between being a naturally funny person and comedy. Example; The Hodge Twins. Now I love them because of....*reasons* (I'm only human!) but I noticed recently that they're doing 'live shows' now. I just don't understand how that's going to work. Is it like a full stand-up show? Have they written and road tested actual jokes? What they do is great for 3-5 minute YouTube videos but I don't see it translating to a stage show. Are the entire audience just going to be pervs like me? It just smacks of a poorly conceived money grab."

Let's go through why this is not only a scummy, but absolutely suicidal business decision:

They're currently the front-runner on 'reaction' videos, furthermore, it is likely they control 90-95% of all views for such type of videos.

Thereby, removing the ability for others to make these videos, does little, if nothing at all to improve their margin.

Along with this, the audience for other channels viewing these videos likely has a near perfect overlap.

Continuing with this, by removing others to make these videos, they lose the chance for new-comers to possibly find them through a competitor.

In the end, they don't look to make money off this - but perhaps lose viewership, and more importantly, trust within a community by restricting content.

Tldr; They're attempting to monopolize an idea they already have a monopoly on, one of the worst PR movies imaginable.

In my opinion, it's really killed the way we share content compared to before. Nowadays, with YouTube (and YouTubers) trying to capitalize on every single thing possible, other creators can't fully display creative freedom without first having obtained the proper rights. It's created an unnecessarily competitive 'market' that now limits many growing users who have amazing ideas, but can't properly share them without fear of infringement. This Fine Bros instance is just one more thing to add fuel to the fire with.

I'll quote here the answer from David Mullich:

> Possibly. A claim for copyright infringement requires proof of two elements: that the plaintiff owns a copyright, and that the defendant copied original elements of the plaintiff’s copyrighted work. To prove infringement, a plaintiff must prove access and substantial similarity between the works at issue.  This protection is what prevents reality show television producers from making shows with the identical format to such franchise shows as Survivor, American Idol or Big Brother, with the only differences being, say, the title of the show, details of the set design, and the people who are the hosts or judges.

> Now, if your channel contains too many similarities to the Fine Brothers' channel, you could be at risk of copyright infringement.  It would be up to a judge to determine whether your channel is similar enough to the other channel to constitute copyright infringement, should the Fine Brothers decide to take you to court.

> However, there are exceptions to franchise protection.

> If the basic idea of the franchise can only be expressed in a limited number of ways, then the expression itself will not be protected, except possibly against identical copying, as allowing that would give a virtual monopoly to the first person expressing the idea.  I've never watched the React shows, so I don't know how many different ways there is to do a show like theirs.

> There is also the exception of scènes à faire, where the elements of a work are used by so many other similar works that they are considered stock elements.  An example in mystery stories would be the ending where the detective gathers all the suspects and eliminates them one-by-one; such a scene might have originated in an Agathy Christie novel, but such scenes are now so commonly found in other mystery novels that you are free to use a similar scene in your own novel.

From the looks of it, the current situation would fall under the first exception. There is a very, very limited number of ways to build a ""React"" video. You show people whatever you wanna show them, record their reactions, and then you either ask questions or don't. I can't think of any other way to express a React video, since it's so straightforward.

Now the real question is: What exactly constitutes the ""format"" that they are claiming copyright on? Is it as broad as recording people's reactions and then asking questions? Or is it specific as cutting away from person to person, showing relevant facts on the bottom of the screen, etc...?

Since they don't give us a specific definition, it appears as they are intentionally going for vagueness in order to sue people."

They had a lazy but enjoyable concept with Kids React, and I enjoyed them for about their first year. Then the kids got more annoying (imo) and most of them have already seen what they're watching. Then they added Teens React and Elders React, which were pretty tame at first, but they soon felt like the same Kids React I was already watching. 

They always seemed like they didn't know what they were doing. Then series after series as they became a company and made lazy idea after lazy idea (we've got kids, old people, and teenagers reacting. What's next? Uh…Adults React? genius.) and they felt even more clueless and corporate than before.

The whole React World thing is hypocritical to say the least.

Fine Bros have made their money by using an old concept and other people's content and are now trying to corner the market.

They are being extremely vague on the infringements of their 'format'. How far does it go?

Because this is about intellectual property, all people who try to protect intellectually property are immediately viewed negatively.

Why?

Because the core demographic of reddit routinely violates intellectual property on a day-to-day basis, but do not like to view themselves as in the wrong, and definitely do not want to ever be culpably in the wrong.  So if they're not wrong, then people who bring suit or threaten to bring suit are automatically wrong to protect their self-image.

And the closer it is to their actual intellectual property violations, the more they will lash out.  As this involves youtube, which they can easily imagine themselves some day using and even creating content for, they feel very strongly about this.

And that's all you ever need to know about popular opinion of reddit on intellectual property matters.

Whether the accused have the legal right to do so or even if the accused *must* do so to protect themselves has no bearing on the popular opinion, which is completely narcissistic.

You could already make Reaction videos. Now what you have to do is go through them, share your ad revenue if you want to make a Reaction video. They have copyrighted many terms, including ""react"". So if you have ""react' in there in any way, you have to pay them money.

To the extent they're offering some added value through promotion and technical assistance, that's great and they can do whatever licensing they want with that to basically have people become React Channel franchisees. But it is highly suspicious that they're claiming unlicensed reaction videos aren't ""legal."" Then again, it could be [FUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt).

All that happened is that they filed for several trademarks, most of which make sense as they are their channel names, and one or two trademarks which are definitely too open-ended. Once again, we're talking about *trademarks*, not copyright. This is in reference to a brand (i.e phrase, title, description, etc of a person/entity), not conceptual content.

So in other words, Fine Bros were trying to lay claim to certain show names (channels), most of which were specific in nature and piloted by themselves. A couple of the requests were from their perspective preemptive trademarks in case they expand their channel lineup to include more concepts ""X Reacts, Y Reacts, etc"". While I definitely think that the open-ended requests are *too* open-ended, I don't think it's absurd that they tried to get them.

**TL;DR The Fine Bros is not somehow applying to have the right to be the exclusive source of all reaction videos, they're trying to trademark what they consider to be their brand; specifically their ""X Reacts"" series of videos.** If their trademark was granted, people could still make reaction videos, but they would not be allowed to deliberately mimic the naming/format of The Fine Bros videos. If a person made a single video called *""My brother Jim reacts to the latest dessert out of Japan""*, it would not be infringement. If someone made a video called *""Lizardmen React to The Legend of Zelda (2019)""*, it *might* be determined to be infringement in court, particularly if the contents of the video also mimiced the Fine Bros videos, or if the person had created a series of videos called *""Lizardmen React""*.

**So while this is a case of an overtly generalized trademark request, this post completely blows it out of proportion.**"

Also, you cannot copyright a concept, only a work e.g. a book, film, song, program etc.

Possibly, the idea of reaction videos could be patented in the US with its crazy patent law, but I think prior art and the inventive step would probably make this unlikely. Perhaps some specific method. But the patent would have a short life anyway, much less than copyright.

So, what we are left with is that they could claim or register trademark on a bunch of terms, but they'd need to be able to defend these, which could be difficult.

They'd also have copyright over the content that they produce - just like everyone else, and could choose to license this how they see fit.

1) A couple of turds take an old format, make a video with kids watching another video and it is quite funny. The videos do well.

2) They expand format in a money-grab to include old people looking at videos, mothers, priests, dogs, anything watching another video. Mentally subordinate people in their masses flock to watch

3) Making several thousand dollars a day for virtually nothing is not enough for these pioneers of media entertainment and so they think they can use the broken YouTube copyright system to extort people who make similar styles of video/use the word react in their titles and threaten to shut down the videos unless you licence their format from them in exchange for lots of your money (But wait! You don't have to pay up front!).

In the React World FAQ, the FineBros address the difference between between the Reaction genre and the FBE owned formats that they are licensing and say this: ""There is an entire genre of Reaction videos online and an unlimited number of ways to make this type of content. **We do not hold a copyright on reaction videos overall. No one can.** React World is about licensing FBE's show formats. This is similar to TV where you can't make a show substantially similar to ""America's Got Talent,"" but of course you can make a completely different talent competition series. Same deal here. The FBE owned formats that we are licensing refer specifically to the 11 shows that we are licensing for use. Those shows are: Kids React, Teens React, Adults React, Elders React, People vs. Food, People vs. Technology, Try Not To Smile or Laugh, Lyric Breakdown, and Do They Know It.""

This is not a feel good we wanna enable the world statement.

Your reaction is exactly what they're hoping for, however, it may end up giving them more power over reaction videos in general than might feel right to you or I.

Say a small retirement home does a reaction video with their residents and doesn't contact the Fine Bros first. The Fine Bros will be able to file a copyright claim and have the video removed because it is Elders react to Y.

That's how Trademarks work basically.

The term 'Idol' is a trademark with respect to television competition shows. 

You can still make videos of people watching things, you just can't call them ""People React"" or whatever. They have built and are entitled to protect a brand around that term.

But if you are allowed to call your videos ""Kids React: Ireland"" or something then you can benefit from their brand recognition. That's what makes a license valuable. 

In addition you get lots of resources from them to help you make the show without having to learn the various lessons they have over the past decade or whatever."

But before we get to that point, ""REACT"" will be able to use YouTube's takedown system to remove all other ""react"" videos from the site. 

If that's not the intent, It's as simple as saying what they consider ""substantially similar"" to them. If they don't, it's because they know people aren't going to ""react"" well to it. 

It's clear that what will be legally ""substantially similar"" will be much more narrow than what they think it means."

Individual productions of those shows are copyrighted.  So Episode 1, Season 1 of Got Talent or whatever has copyright protection.

The talent show format is not copyright protected.

A specific element of the show, like the one with the spinning chair lets say, could be registered as a trademark, something that is exclusively associated to that specific production.  

The name, also, could be protected with a mark.

But the way they describe it in the video makes it seem like they are franchising the ""reaction"" style video generally. 

Certainly they can sell graphics, video packages, production help etc however they want, but I can't see their angle in protecting the concept of a reaction video as a general thing.  Certainly some element or elements could be trademarked, and even maybe the topic lists or whatever could be copy protected (although generally lists of things can't be copyrighted).

That's why it's a weird business model.  There is no intellectual property protection that would prevent me from offering a competing service with my own branding but otherwise nearly identical.

So if some guy uploads a video of his kids watching a sad scene in a movie and titles it ""Kids react to Gerry the Dinosaur dying!"" and it goes viral, the Fine Bro's could then ask google to remove it via their automated system, ""Kids React is our copyright/trademark/brand!"" They could then contact that father and tell him that he can reupload the video but only if he signs their licensing contract and they get revenue from it. 

Likewise, lets say there's a marginally popular channel that regularly produces React-style videos and has been doing it well before Finebro's began doing it or before they became popular for doing it, the Finebro's would now be able to essentially stamp out any sort of competition he might have presented despite the fact that he's just a medium-sized channel with a modest viewer base and has been doing react videos for much longer than the Finebro's. Youtube only cares that a close partner and apparent copyright holder requests that his videos get removed due to copyright violation. Sure, the guy can take Finebro's to court, but he's going to have a hell of a time getting his channel fixed. 

In the real world, it's not such a big deal and is even a good thing when you copyright or trademark a name/brand/etc... Because to force someone to stop their business that you think is infringing on your copyright, you have to take them to court and prove it. On youtube, however, you just have to click a few buttons and then it's up to the person who now has their videos removed or account closed to prove that they did nothing wrong rather than the Fine Bro's having to prove that what they did was legal or correct and not an abuse of youtubes automated copyright protection systems.

This also shows a complete misunderstanding of the concept of IP law. The purpose of a Copyright is to protect artists/creators.

They would look different. Some would have one person. Some would have many. Some would be 30 seconds long. Some would be 30 minutes long. Some would have a bunch of computer graphics. etc etc etc

These guys came up with a specific way to show people reacting to shit. It's NOT just randomly put together. They have like 5-6 people that they quickly introduce. Then they show them watching a clip that they show in a window in the upper right corner. They get some initial reactions. Then there's an interview section. Then there's a section where they reveal info about the clip the reactors might not know. More questions. Etc.

It's a specific sequence of clips. It's a FORMAT which is the most important thing next to the idea.

So these guys are offering to share with you their format and give you guildelines that they probably use themselves to make videos that are consistent. And also you get to associate with their successful brand. 

This is basically like a franchise. You could open your own pizza delivery place. Nobody would sue you. Or you can open a Domino's franchise where they tell you how to do everything and basically you just have to do the work.

And you take part in this ONLY IF YOU CHOSE TO.

They are not copyrighting ""a video where people react."" They are copyrighting their FORMAT.

**This is exactly like a country wanting to do their version of ""BLANK'S GOT TALENT"" like America's Got Talent and Britain's Got Talent. So what do they do? They get a license to make their own version of the show. They are told what the format is, given graphics, fonts, music, everything they need to make their own version. And in return, they give some of the money to the people who own the FORMAT FOR THE SHOW.**

People using that exact format and posting their videos to youtube has been around since before the Fine Bros evens started uploading videos. Ever watch ""I love the 80's"" on VH1 back in the early 2000's? It was just a bunch of comedians watching videos from the 80's and reacting to them. The Fine Bros basically took something that already existed and put it on Youtube. Now that they've gotten rich off of it, they are attempting to shut the door on everyone else unless they get paid for an idea that wasn't even theirs.

Now we really need to focus on what exactly they are attempting to claim as their intellectual property. What exactly is ""their format"" that they claim everyone else is stealing? Is their format just a bunch of people watching a video and then answering some questions? Is there anything more than this that's original or unique to their ""format""?

Can someone then copyright the ""Harlem Shake"" format? Or the Condom Challenge format? Etc? Because as far as I'm concerned, all those things are more original than their ""react"" format."

EDIT #2: Think of it this way... the Fine Bros don't have the power to copyright anything they want. There are specific and defined legal boundaries for copyright set forth by the US Government Copyright office, their desire to copyright their intellectual property is shared by millions of people that create intellectual property themselves. OP's claims are based purely in fear and ignorance that somehow the Fine Bros can ""copyright whatever they want""



Very misleading title. No, they are in fact NOT trying to copyright ""reaction videos"". They're trying to protect their very specific format on how they do the show and open it up for others to use. I mean literally, copying their branding/backgrounds/scripts etc.

It's already illegal to copy their react format, the only thing that's changing is that if you *want* to (which currently nobody has), you can now share revenue with them. **Literally no one making react videos previously, now, or in the future will be affected by this change.**

It's the same reason why you can't copy every element of the price is right, and just change the name of it to call it your own. You can't copy someone's format and call it your own, this is not new.

I know more people don't understand intellectual property and copyright, but damn this is pretty obvious.

tldr; No, the fine bros are NOT attempting to copyright ""reaction videos"""

Your title is extremely misleading, as well as just being incorrect. From what they've said in the video, and in the comment section, you can now use their specific format and art style if you're willing to licence for free under their network. Their format isn't ""watch a thing, and then talk about it"" so much as it's the overlays and layout.

They'd be stupid to try and enforce copyright on reaction videos, which is why they're not. What this prevents is someone directly taking their art assets and reusing them without accreditation.

Put it this way. Roosterteeth owns the channel ""Let's Play"", but they do not own the copyright to the term, nor do they suggest that people who make something with the word Let's Play are infringing their copyright.

If they aren't trying to copyright the reaction format, then what exactly are they trying to copyright when they say they own the kids react, teens react, elders react, etc format? Those shows are all the same thing! Just a bunch of people watching a video and talking about it. That's what they're trying to copyright but now that they are getting backlash, they are trying to pretend otherwise.

I would too if the Reddit brigade crashed my video and started demanding apologies and yelling retribution. They are trying to maintain some form of order in their own comment section of their own video to try and stop the spread of misinformation.

They have clearly realised how this looks now, hence the comments by themselves explaining the situation (which should have been in the video). That still does not mean that they are doing what everyone is claiming they are.

They are (I imagine) putting a copyright on their overlays for the various videos, the intros used in each of their series, the format of having ""Question Time"" come up, the layout they use of 1/4 video + 3/4 reactors + info at the bottom. They have a placeholder that they just reuse when someone is speaking that a fact pops up in, but they change the text, photo and title of it. Those are the things they are licensing.

Reddit can over-react (HA!, pun) to this the same way it jumps on other issues that infuriate it but in all honesty, this is nothing new. They won't copyright reaction videos, and the people who say they are or call them nazis will just be ignored until they forget about this whole thing. They might lose a few thousand subscribers but when your channel is +14m, and you're expanding your brand and allowing others the creative tools to help you in that effort, who gives a shit about such a tiny percentage of the population."

All they are trying to do is prevent people from uploading their videos or videos that are made to look like they were produced by them.

They're also trying to start some sort of ""reaction channel network"" which does seem to be a shady way of generating more income from other channels making similar stuff by ""licensing"" them to use their branding, but with 14 million subscribers on the main channel that does mean that cross promotion between licensed channels could be very beneficial for ""licensees"".

3182,czfii4n,t3_43490c,t1_czfi8tm,1454011835,Austin_Rivers,5,1,0,0,5,"Here's a more thorough look at what they are trying to do. At the core of it, I still want to challenge anyone reading this to ask themselves: **what is the format that they are copyrighting?** Because their format is VERY unoriginal and VERY simple. If they can copyright that, then news agencies should copyright their far more complicated format of presenting the news with various anchors, news ticker, etc.

Here is their blog post (Which they are editing and monitoring in order to do damage control and throw their PR spin on this):

https://medium.com/@FineBrothersEnt/announcing-react-world-the-future-of-entertainment-1e6c0b708ab9#.1mm3x5rti

>We’ve trademarked all our shows, which means they are legally protected

Please read it if you have the chance.

And watch the video starting here:

https://youtu.be/r2UqT6SZ7CU?t=2m3s

They are extremely careful about their language to make it seem like they are doing the exact opposite of what they are doing. They want to make it seem like they are encouraging content but they really just want to siphon off money from content creators by claiming that they OWN the very format of ""reaction"". They are saying that kids react, teens react, and all other reacts are THEIR format and that you need to buy a license from them to do it legally. If you do not, you are STEALING their format/intellectual property.

They are complaining that their format is being ""blatantly stolen by companies and people..."".

From their blog they said this:

>It’s still too easy to steal other’s ideas, and creator rights are being trampled.

>We’re now experiencing a shift back to old competitive behaviors where media creators will pile on to what they see as successful in order to make money themselves. Unfortunately, the industry best practices, the platform rules and features, and the global courts have not kept pace with this change and there are no real consequences for violating intellectual property, stealing ideas, concepts, and ripping off formats.

>This is happening everywhere, from mega companies like Buzzfeed constantly ripping off other show concepts and formats; to individuals who are trying to piggyback off the success of other creator’s formats [NOTE: REACT FORMAT]

>If you know anything about us, you know we don’t tend to keep our opinions to ourselves, and have been vocal directly with YouTube, the industry and others about the need to continually evolve practices and **protections**.

>When you look at traditional media, you see that formats ripoffs have been a huge problem in the past. Producers and media companies will see that a certain format or story has gotten breakout success, and will copycat it as much as they can.

So watch this video and read the blog. Ask yourself, what format are they licensing and claiming as their ""intellectual property""? Why do they think other people are stealing their format/intellectual property? And what are they doing about it?

Well, they use very very selective language to conceal their true motive. They keep trying to make it sound like what they're doing is SUPPORTING the people already making reaction videos. But what they really want is to lock up the ""reaction format"" and LICENSE it to ""ANYONE"" who wants to make these videos. The problem is, people, ANYONE, can already make these videos. But they don't currently pay the Fine Bros. That's what this video and initiative is really trying to change. To have other people pay the Fine Bros.

And let's see, right now, everyone on youtube making reaction videos are doing it happily right now. They have full control over their content. But what will this initiative change? Let's read their own words:

>**We’ve trademarked all our shows, which means they are legally protected**

>We can revoke the license at any time.

>All brand integrations must run through FBE 

>This is a purely digital license. You will not be able to turn the format into TV shows or be paid by third parties to create the content. If you are contacted for brand, distribution, merch or other opportunities related to the licensed format, FBE will take lead in those conversations

Don't forget that once something is recognized as ""trademarked/legally protected"", they don't need to take you to court, they can just get Google/Youtube to take down your videos at their request. Try uploading Star Wars TFA on youtube and see how long it lasts. Well, Mutlichannel networks on youtube has long had the same power. They have gained ""recognition"" from youtube and can take down channels that uses any of its IP at will. That's why people had such a hard to criticizing prank channels in the past few weeks, because those prank channels belong to huge networks that strike down videos for BS reasons. Well, if the Fine Bros succeed, they will gain the same power. They claim react formats are theirs, so they can take down people stealing their format. It's bullshit, this is a total money grab. If they ONLY offered a service to help others make videos, then what they say about encouraging content would be true. But no, they are saying that ALL react videos are committing copyright violations, that the Fine Bros own the React format, and that once they succeed, they'll offer a ""service"" to people making react videos where they can pay the Fine Bros for the right to make their videos."

While not actively saying what the title suggests, for example if they were to say that H3H3 productions are copying them and a liable to sue (which I'd highly doubt would ever happen), then they can completely go fuck themselves.

However I don't see this being the case, but then I am talking shit and posting a reaction to their video, so let's see how this unfolds because this could lead to the same favouritism shit that prank channels pull day to day, taking down people's videos for copyright claims.

You can't have a brand name that is already a commonly used phrase or a generic description. Thermos, escalator, heroin, kerosene, mimeograph, trampoline, and even videotape were all once trademarked brands. The owners of brands such as Kleenex, LEGO, Frisbee, Google, and others are very much aware of this and actively fight the generization of these words by specifying that they are ""Kleenex facial tissues"", ""LEGO toy building bricks"", ""Google search engine"", etc. The problem is that in this instance, the phrase has already been genericized before someone (the Fine Bros) is trying to trademark it. It's equivalent to a furniture company trying to trademark the word ""chair"".

We do not hold a copyright on reaction videos overall. No one can. React World is about licensing FBE's show formats, not just for shows like Kids React, but also others like ""Do They Know It?,"" ""Lyric Breakdown,"" and more. This is similar to TV where you can't make a show substantially similar to ""America's Got Talent,"" but of course you can make a completely different talent competition series. Same deal here.

This could have been added later, and someone here might have pointed it out already, but there's definitely some shady stuff going on here.

A noticeable turning point was the ""Youtubers React"" series.

That series serves no other purpose than hyping up each others channels, it's basically a Youtube circlejerk.

Basically, someone could create a video like ""Jurassic World Reaction Video"" with no issues at all. No one can stop them. But the fine bros are trying to license their formats so that people will instead do ""Elders React to Dinosaurs! (Jurassic World)"" or whatever dumb shit they do. This will allow them to copy their video set up as well as put them into the Fine Bros ""React World"" community where they have a giant circle jerk of reaction content.

Now, this is scummy as fuck because they will be taking a portion of these people's money, and it's just as bad as if your title was true, which it isn't. But the people that join will get access to the community itself and in turn, probably get more views than they would have with their own reaction format.

So they can't trademark/copy-write the format, duh. But what they do ""own"" is kids react, teens react, adults react, elders react,  ect. So those are all four major age groups that could be represented and trademarked are.

Ok so they have 4 out of 4 age brackets. Once they have those done what stops them from obtaining more IP and just claiming it's a minor derivative of their work? You can't have ""elementary students"" react, nor can you have ""south-western retiree's from Florida"" react. Now what falls under their umbrella of ownership? What else can they grab? If they suddenly decide to do Koreans react even though it already exists, could they claim it still because they're technically teens/adults? Would they have a case? Would youtube care since TheFineBros get more views and more money and could handle a lawsuit better than smaller companies?

Let's use a parallel example:

Coke. Someone had made soda before so they can't own ""soda"". However coke has a formula that can be defined and trademarked. Now they own cherry coke, but let's say that they won the trademark for and now own ""cherry flavored soda"". Now, no soda company can make cherry flavored soda. Now coke has other flavors including, Cola, vanilla, orange, ect, ect that they trademark as well. Then they get/have so much clout and money they can pretty much run over everyone else no problem. 

Now those examples may/may not hold up in court, but here's the rub: youtube will take down any videos TheFineBros wants. Denying revenue and attention, and giving more money to theFineBros to handle anyone that would sue them in meat court. This is where it's a problem.

They are trademarking the format of the show. Not the act of reacting to a video.
For example, a show like America's Got Talent can be trademarked. Even if talent shows have existed way before Television.
What is trademarked is the very specific format of the show. You can't have another talent show with 3-5 judges with big Xs and a host and the life story of the contestant and etc, etc, etc...

The video you linked and the ""Young/Old/Youtube/etc React"" videos are both of people reacting to a video.
But the format of how it is presented is very very different.
You and everyone else will still be able to upload your videos of you and your friends reacting to something.

I can contact the Fine Bros. license their production tools, ie. graphics, music, and format.

I enjoyed the REACT Content, merely because it provided a small window, flawed as it was, to individuals reacting to new content. 

It engaged in some careful thought and they did research on the subject, that seemed fairly well.

Youtube is only JUST branching out further with Youtube Red or Youtube Gaming, trying to legitimize online resources over television. And this is what they're going to do? And they're CENSORING any backlash? 

This is absolutely fucking gross. I have taken away my subscription, and will NEVER watch a single video of theirs again. I will not add revenue to their pockets, I will not endorse or inflate their viewership numbers, I will not use word of mouth to spread their content toward others, I will not vouch for or defend them in whatever context they appear in when it comes to the future. 

All things I had done prior. Small impacts, certainly, but I would've been apathetic towards this at best (Probably just stopped at unsub) if they weren't pretending to be heroes, and weren't censoring any comment that criticizes their intent. Now instead of a fan? They have someone who hates their work and will happily side against them, alongside multiple scores of people, even tapping into people who never knew them before.

There are no upfront costs when you license from us. When you join React World you enter into a revenue share agreement based on actual revenue generated by your videos. There are two kinds of revenue, that which is generally YouTube adsense, and the other is more premium brand deals. If you connect your channel to React World on Youtube, your split is 80% of adsense and 70% of premium brand deals. If you are independent on YouTube or in an MCN, the split is 60% of adsense and 50% of premium brand deals.

- Reddit is only letting us reply one post every 10 minutes not sure why, trying to fix, will reply here and there. Sorry for the confusion.  Due to this, we have been answering questions over there. And will try to get to people over there as we can. 

Benny & Rafi Fine here to clear the confusion and answer your questions - please reply to this thread and we will be answering throughout the day. Please see below to clarify what React World is. 

1: We do not hold a copyright on reaction videos overall. No one can. It isn’t something you can copyright.

2: We are not going after/shutting down/sueing anyone who makes reaction based content. We are licensing our specific shows and their structural elements. 

3: On the confusion around what we mean by our “format” we do NOT mean “people reacting to videos” we mean the structural elements of the FBE series.  Most series have protectable elements, which is why you see multiple shows across entertainment that have the same idea, but a different presentation.  The FBE series (Such as “Kids React”, “Lyric Breakdown”, & “Do They Know It?"" also have trademarks in terms of their title, and elements like their title cards, timing, graphical elements, etc. which is what you are licensing in terms of what we mean by “format”. 

4: We don’t like to make parallels to TV but think of it like this.  You have a TV network in another country and want to make a singing show.  You can make a brand new format on your own and come up with every aspect of that series and hope it works out (and it might do great) or you can pay to license an established brand (like an “American Idol”) and make a your version which could increase your chances of success as well as give you the tools to produce the series efficiently.  

To us, this is a way to connect with our viewers and allow people to make their own version of a show they love to watch. Again we’ll be replying in this thread if there are further questions.

You posted this two days ago, and the last 48 hours, the front page has been speckled with report after report of small YouTube content creators getting hit by your company. You are totally going after people, you have algorithms scouring YouTube looking for anything with ""react"" in the title and indiscriminately taking it down.

You know what doesn't lie? Numbers. http://socialblade.com/youtube/user/thefinebros/realtime

You have got to be kidding. This wasn't your idea. You aren't the first. You don't ""own"" this format, and any sensible copyright judge will see to it that you never do.

Liars. Liars and fakes. All of you liars and fakes.

When this broke, I was just hoping you would immediately reverse your decision and apologize. I would've been quick to forgive, because of course companies are prone to not think things through and maybe we all were just being overly paranoid over the trademark claim. But all the hate you're getting, all the distrust and paranoia of people who called you out?

Turns out they didn't need to prove anything. With your blatantly aggressive actions, fully contradictory to your pro-content creator sentiment, you justified every bit of it.

The various takedowns over the last couple days proves you are committed to targeting small content creators. So the opportunity to make a tactical retreat and apologize has passed. That ship is sailed. All I hope now is the unceremonious and embarrassing end to the Fine Bros. I hope you guys straight up fail and end up penniless street beggars with nothing but disgrace and shame to your name.

* Your description of ""copying the look & feel of the series"" is simply too vague. It could be interpreted very broadly or very narrowly. Could you perhaps link to some examples of videos you are confident are not infringing, and other videos you are suspicious are infringing? This would make the debate and discussion more clear."

The trademark on 'react' will mean only they (and their licensees) can call their videos 'react videos' and name shows 'X react'. Anyone else can still make 'reaction videos' and give them any title that doesn't use 'react' in a way that would make you think it is affiliated with the Fine Bros' series.

The problem with getting specific (especially in the second point) is that it is a subjective test: If a reasonable person watches a video, and would assume that the Fine Bros or their company made it, then it is an infringement on the look & feel of their series.

For an obvious theoretical infringement example, take any one of their react shows and compare it to the rest. They use the same timing, the same visual elements (only different in styling), the same intro text ""X reacts to Y"" ""This episode: Z"", and an interview with fact boxes after the reactions.

For an obvious non-infringing example many vloggers have done reaction videos (topical example see Tyler Oakley Reacts to Teens React to Tyler Oakley), these are usually them on screen the whole time, with facts/context beforehand and commentary to the audience after. The only similarity to the Fine Bros' series is that they're doing a reaction, so the ""look & feel"" isn't being copied."

For example if you have an opening sequence ""My Kids react to technology"" ""this episode: NES"", open the reacting portion with the kids having no context, and then after they'd played it you asked them a bunch of questions, all while in studio, with an outro and title cards between segments, then somebody might get the idea that the video was actually made by (or licensed by) the Fine Bros.

The problem with getting specific is that trademark protection is a subjective test. For example even if you had a unique opening sequence but still did everything else just like the Fine Bros do then somebody might assume you're just a different one of their react shows.

As an example if you did your ""My kids react to"" video in a home-movie sort of format then you'll almost certainly be in the clear. In general unless you're trying to copy them you're probably ok.

If you made it a series then calling it 'My kids react' could be a problem because 'Kids react' is one of their shows (it might not be, but I'm no lawyer), you could definitely call it 'My kids experience' or whatever else you can come up with."

This is why it needs to be vague. Even if they made a list of elements they wanted to protect you could still use them all as long as you did it in a different way.

Admit it: You're doing this so no one else can get as big as you.

Also they said this: Yes you can title your videos KIDS REACT TO X once you are legally and officially part of the REACT family.

So YES they ARE trademarking X REACTS TO Y. All they are doing now is lying and backpedaling.

I hope your company tanks so hard that you are left penniless and regretful of your decision. Unless you have kids. In that case I hope you are left penniless and regretful after your wife and kids take all your money."

I suggest you read the case [Religious Technologies Center v.

> Yes you can title your videos KIDS REACT TO X once you are legally and officially part of the REACT family.

So it seems like ""X reacts to Y"" is indeed the title format they are trying to trademark.  I did some basic Googling on intellectual property, and one of the oldest exceptions to trademarks is ""descriptive words and phrases""; the book that I saw on Amazon that mentioned this cited some examples e.g. a company was able to trademark the phrase ""Camel leather belt"" (or something similar) because even though the phrase was describing a product using generic words, they had been the *only* company associated with that product for 10+ years and could say it was exclusively associated with their brand.  Conversely, it mentioned that a similar attempt to trademark ""Chicago style pizza"" failed because there were numerous companies that had made a product that they had described in those terms.  

Have the Fine Brothers been the *only* creators associated with the term ""X reacts to Y"" for so long that no reasonable person could term that phrase a ""generic description""?  Since the only reaction videos I've remembered liking on YouTube were NOT made by them, and reaction videos predated their arrival to YouTube, I'd say no, and I'd hope that YouTube would agree.

The main mechanism of combustion propagation is of a flame front that moves forward through the gas mixture - in technical terms the reaction zone (chemical combustion) progresses through the medium by processes of diffusion of heat and mass. In its most benign form, a deflagration may simply be a flash fire. In contrast, a detonation is characterized by supersonic flame propagation velocities, perhaps up to 2000 m/s, and substantial overpressures, up to 20 bars. The main mechanism of combustion propagation is of a powerful pressure wave that compresses the unburnt gas ahead of the wave to a temperature above the autoignition temperature. In technical terms, the reaction zone (chemical combustion) is a self-driven shock wave where the reaction zone and the shock are coincident, and the chemical reaction is initiated by the compressive heating caused by the shock wave."

It's not for all reaction videos, only those that look, sound, and feel so similar to FBE videos that people confuse the two.  This legal theory puts the burden on FBE to prove that an average consumer in their viewing demographic saw the other company's react video and (1) mistakenly believe that  the video was created by FBE and (2) the other company intended for the viewer to confuse its video with FBE's videos.  This is considered intentional infringement on the brand owner's rights. If it turns out the other company intentionally caused confusion, they're liable to FBE for damages. If it was an honest mistake, they will likely settle for attorney fees out of court. 

Reaction style videos are a genre and cannot be protected by copyright law.  However, the FBE logo, music intro, possibly some of the show titles, etc. could be protected if FBE can prove they're original creations.

Why would anyone believe that a react to video was created by FBE when it's not even on their channel?

How do you prove it though? Filming a group of people reacting to something and questioning them about it is NOT something FBE invented and even if they were the ones who invented it the premise of filming someone's reaction to something and question them is something that happends on daily basis. Not one court in the World would approve such a ""claim"" since it violates the human rights.

>However, the FBE logo, music intro, possibly some of the show titles, etc. could be protected if FBE can prove they're original creations. Heck, even the fonts used can be protected if they were created by FBE for the series.

I don't think anybody questions that but what FBE tries to do is ENTIRELY different. They try to claim copyright for ""insert random group of people here such as Korean girls"" react to something, which is just absurd and ridiculous. (I'm actually speechless).

4750,czhczac,t3_43490c,t1_czfub29,1454137482,FoxLordKurama,1,0,0,0,1,But let's imagine a young new youtuber who makes a video that is similar in style but not an intentional infringement. FBE might threaten to take them to court over this or they can take down the video. The young youtuber might not have the means to go to court and choose to take down the video instead. Isn't that a possible scenario?
4751,czhskft,t3_43490c,t1_czhczac,1454180862,htot,2,0,0,0,2,"I logged in today and had 19 questions.  Wow.

Yes, this scenario is entirely possible and likely.  However, there may be an innocuous reason why it occurs and there is an easy and cheap first response for the young newtuber.  

1. FBE is required to protect its brand if it wants to claim ownership, even if it deep down FBE doesn't care about what young youtuber is doing.  This is because the law requires an owner to actively police and protect its brands.  There was a case regarding a famous artist or photographer (I think it was Ansel Adams) who never bothered to go after publishers that printed and sold their works without paying royalties.  Years later the artist's family began suing the worst perpetrators and the court ruled in favor of the perps b/c the owner had never bothered to pursue them.  It was a rational similar to imminent domain whereby a squatter can earn ownership of land by living on it openly for a period of time.  Thus, anytime FBE learns of a youtuber making video that seems similar to its brand, its legal team will likely send out such a letter to prove that FBE intends to protect its brand. FBE may not actually want the young youtuber to do anything or pay anything and may not even pursue the subject further.  
2. The young youtuber presumably wants to earn recognition and perhaps money for their posted content.  Thus, they need to police and protect their video.  If they believe their video is different enough from FBE to call BS on the cease and desist letter, they should write FBE's registered agent a response on paper, print it out, sign their name, and mail it using Certified Mail with a Return Receipt Requested.  You can find form responses to cease and desist letters on any reputable consumer group website or state attorney general's website.  You must MAIL it with certified mail and a return receipt requested to show FBE that you understand the law and are putting your answer down on paper, not a virtual response.  This has important legal distinctions and will only cost the young youtuber $7.00 at a local post office.  Heck, some states even allow you to send it using UPS or FedEx, but email NEVER counts.  NEVER.  NEVER EVER.  NEVER EVER EVER.  (Sorry, part of my work is in consumer law and this point fucks my clients over more than any other.)
3. Lastly, a young youtuber that is savvy enough to create a reaction video and post it to youtube, is likely savvy enough to throw together a crap font logo and stick at the start of the tape.  This would be further proof that young youtuber never intended for their content to be confused with others'. 
4.  You'd be amazed how much Step #2 puts an end to this shit.  Combine it with Step #3 and you've got a pretty solid situation for the young youtuber.

Please note that the vote numbers are not ""real"" numbers, they have been ""fuzzed"" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the submission, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes.

I mean, I know that Facebook trademarked ""Face"" and ""book"", and Apple trademarked ""Apple"", but these are only enforceable in the context of their use by the company.  Facebook and Apple couldn't sue a website offering facelifts or the owners of an apple orchard - what they produce isn't closely associated with literal faces, books or apples.  Only in the context of social media or computers is the word ""Face"" or ""Apple"" instantly associable with a specific brand.  But a video titled ""Kids/Parents react to X"" has no association with any specific brand or company in my mind, and if the title is simply describing what the product actually *is* I can't see how this is enforceable.

Not necessarily. 

For the TEENS REACT mark, the listing of services include ""Entertainment services, namely, an *on-going series* of web site programs in the field of observing and *interviewing* teenagers."" (Emphasis added). 

A teenager could very well make a video of Donald Trump taking a shit on a homeless person, label the video ""Teens React to Trump Taking a Dump,"" and post it online without infringing the TEENS REACT mark despite their video including those exact terms. 

You could probably even argue that a simple reaction video does not reach the level of ""an on-going series of web site programs."" It's just one video.

I didn't do a search of all their marks, so who knows, they could very well have another TEENS REACT mark wherein the listing of services are more broad than the one above. "

I just don't understand all these trademarks lately with generic terms. Saga went through this. I guess this is the year it can officially be a registered trademark. I think that's pretty unfair too. That's the world we live in though.
4981,czgjoaq,t3_43490c,t1_czgimpd,1454086607,thatsreallydumb,5,0,0,0,5,"At its core, trademarks are source identifiers. If you use a generic term/phrase to identify a specific product/service, and people come to associate you as the source of that product/service, then you should be able to have trademark protection on those generic terms/phrases. 

For example, let's look at CHIPOTLE. Everyone associates CHIPOTLE with the fast food chain now, despite chipotle being a type of pepper. Should Chiptole lose their trademark protection because their name is simply a type of pepper? I don't think so. They're acured enough goodwill in the CHIPOTLE mark such that people have come to identify them as the source of a product. 

If enough people over time associate TEENS REACT with The Fine Bros' videos, then I think they should be able to get trademark protection for that term. The scope of that protection will be limited to what is recited in the listing of goods and services. "

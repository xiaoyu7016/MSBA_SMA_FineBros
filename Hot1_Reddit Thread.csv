Copyright law generally protects the actual works (in this case, specific videos) themselves - including taking clips and sections of those works for remixing. Yes, you can *try* to use it for format and other elements (the most obvious one being stealing people's original characters) but it's very, very hard to copyright a general format/storyline. Personally - and again, IANAL - I can't see how they could go after anyone who wasn't trying really quite hard to mimic the exact style. The creative/non-obvious bar is just going to cut them off at the knees. 

Maybe I'm missing something - it's true that they DO seem to be trying to exert copyright... but I struggle to see how they're going to pull that one off in any context without the more stringent (and they are much more stringent) ability to thwack people for trademark abuse. This is actually why special characters (like mickey mouse) fall under both copyright *and* trademark - because my understanding is it's much easier to hit things with trademark than with copyright *when you're not actually using the specific artistic work*.

Personally - and again, IANAL - I can&#39;t see how they could go after anyone who wasn&#39;t trying really quite hard to mimic the exact style. The creative/non-obvious bar is just going to cut them off at the knees. </p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m missing something - it&#39;s true that they DO seem to be trying to exert copyright... but I struggle to see how they&#39;re going to pull that one off in any context without the more stringent (and they are much more stringent) ability to thwack people for trademark abuse. This is actually why special characters (like mickey mouse) fall under both copyright <em>and</em> trademark - because my understanding is it&#39;s much easier to hit things with trademark than with copyright <em>when you&#39;re not actually using the specific artistic work</em>. </p>

Copyright is ridiculous (at least in the US) because of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which implores companies like YouTube to respond to claims of copyright infringement by shooting first and asking questions later, lest they be held responsible for all content uploaded by all people to their servers.

It's NOT true that they're exerting COPYRIGHT here.  Nothing about that video changes their stance on copyright.  On TRADEMARK, they are opening up to people to partner with them and use their TRADEMARK.

I have been reading about trademark law recently, and this is based on my understanding.*

It depends. In trademark law there's this thing called ""nominative use"", which means you can use words in a descriptive sense, even if they're trademarked.

For example:

* a program selling itself as ""App McAwesome for Apple OS X"" would not need to license the names ""Apple"" or ""OS X"" because it's describing the app.

* if you sell a perfume with a 'love potion' scent , you would not infringe on the 'Love Potion' range of perfumes because you're using 'love potion' to describe the scent, not to trick people into thinking it was Love Potion-branded perfumes. (This was an actual trademark case, *Dessert Beauty Inc. v. Fox*.)

You increase your chances of winning a case if you a) prominently display your own trademark (so as to not confuse the viewer of the 'source' of your product - i.e. to prevent them from thinking it was an official React video) and b) display the word in question in a way that isn't prominent, or as prominent as your own trademark. In *Dessert Beauty*, the defendant's own brand was displayed much more prominently than the words ""love potion"", which were written in a plain serif font.

So, based on my understanding, if I made a video called ""MARKKB PRESENTS: these people react to grass growing"", I'd have a better chance than if I had titled it ""These People React: Grass Growing"".","<div class=""md""><p><em>Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice.

One the one hand, you have a pair of people that are clearly getting greedy when it comes to content, but I think there is a sliver of truth to them saying that they don't want to see the 'reaction' content deteriorate to any lower than it currently has. 

Now that we know GradeA *really* dislikes reaction channels, but he's said it's because he doesn't like the lack-of-effort content that they put out and that they are essentially stealing content from other YouTubers; the rules of reaction videos meaning there's nothing anyone can do. He's also said he likes the ""React To"" videos from TFB; could be that he might see this as a way to purge the shit content from YouTube and only have the quality reaction videos up there.

Now saying that - what's to say that the other reaction channels that are up there and actually do good work(or at least put a little effort into their content) don't deserve a little slice of the Fine Bros pie here. Will reaction YouTubers have to be licensed by Reaction World in order to put out the content that they're known for?

It's a difficult situation, and ultimately I think that TFB are in the wrong, wholly, but it has to be said that of all the reaction content out there that theirs is the best, and without it none of the other famous reaction channels would be even close to the amount of exposure they have right now.

**Before anyone continue to defend what the Fine Bros are doing, they are just using PR talk to confuse you and pretend like they are ""franchising"" their specific brand. No, they are using React World to capture ALL react videos. They are already using their lawyers to bully others who make react videos. Here are some common responses defending the Fine Bros and why they are incorrect:**

----

**The Fine Bros are just branding their specific react videos, not all reaction videos**

1.	They have already legally trademarked Kids React, Teens React, and Elders React. They have been using their lawyers to threaten other channels who are attempting to make videos of kids react videos for years.
2.	Once React World launches, react videos of any demographic that falls under their media empire are their trademark. You can currently make “engineers react”, or “nurses react”, but once the Fine Bros successfully trademark all of these reaction types, they can use their lawyers to threaten you just like they currently threaten you for making kids react videos.
3.	They feel so entitled to their “format” that they think anything remotely similar to one of their “formats” is infringing on their intellectual property. They even threatened ELLEN for stealing their “format”. Ellen’s video is nothing like anything the Fine Bros do, she’s just showing kids on her show some old technology: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CMS9xnBRkc They made a facebook post calling Ellen thieves and bullies stealing and not respecting the Fine Bros. They’ve deleted that post but their tweet still exists (please screen cap it before they delete this too): https://twitter.com/thefinebros/status/513061415016341504
4.	In summary, the Fine Bros have always felt entitled to their unoriginal and stolen format. They say they won’t go after other content creators but they have been using their lawyers to shut down other content creators for years. They feel so entitled that they even considered that Ellen segment an infringement on their “format”. 

This should give you a VERY clear idea of what kind of people and what kind of motive the Fine Bros have.

**These guys are just licensing their shows to others, what’s the big deal?**

1.	That is their PR talk. Let’s look at their actions. They’ve used their leverage with Youtube to take down channels that were making kids react videos and seniors react videos. They’ve even threatened Ellen on Facebook and tried to use their fans to brigade Ellen for daring to produce this segment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CMS9xnBRkc

**They are just talking about their specific format, brand, etc. Not a big deal**

1.	They trademark every aspect of their “format” which already overlaps with what other reaction videos are. 

2. Once they use their fans to expand their trademark into every type of react video under the sun, then they can use their legal leverage to push you out. 

----

**The Fine Bros’ Strategy to trademark ALL react videos**

1.	Make no mistake about it, the Fine Bros fully intend on making ALL react videos theirs. And React World is how they will do it. The Fine Bros already trademarked kids react, teens react, elders react, etc. You cannot make a video of kids reacting to redbull and call it “kids react to Redbull”. Don’t believe me? Here are the Fine Bros’ own words: http://imgur.com/oik8CsA
2.	So how does this lead to them trademarking ALL react videos? Well once React World goes online, and people of all demographics make react videos and put them under Fine Bros’ empire, they will then trademark all of those new react titles the same way they did with Kids React. In other words, you can make “Nurses React” right now because they haven’t trademarked it, but once Nurses React becomes part of their empire through React World, they can then trademark it and stick their lawyers on you threatening you with legal action unless you take your videos down. THIS is how they intend on taking over ALL reaction videos. It’s underhanded, manipulative, and has enough steps in between for them the have hidden this in plain sight.
3.	If you still don’t believe this, then try making a kids react video right now and call it “kids react to ___”. YOU CAN’T. The Fine Bros have used their lawyers to threaten people who have done this already and they’ll do it to you. Do not believe them when they say they won’t prevent other people from making other “types” of reaction videos. They will only allow you to make your videos until they trademark your video’s name. They will do that through React World because they don’t need to put in any effort into actually making content anymore.

**What is The Fine Bros Afraid of?**

The Fine Bros' office employs over 40 people and have HUGE overheads. Beyond losing a few subscribers, what the Fine Bros are afraid of the most right now is **losing their sponsors**. They get very little money from Youtube ads compared to their sponsors. Here's them talking about their sponsors two years ago:

&gt;The company has created branded content for Universal Studios’ “A Million Ways to Die in the West,” AMC’s “Halt and Catch Fire,” Friskies cat food and Audible. “We have a series that is something brands can be organically integrated into,” Benny said.

&gt;The Fine Bros. are affiliated with YouTube multichannel network Fullscreen. They are repped by WME and managed by Max Benator.

http://variety.com/2014/digital/news/youtubes-fine-bros-launch-react-channel-1201266727/

They recently did a brand deal with Disney for Star Wars too.

They've taken on so many employees and have so much overhead cost that losing even a single sponsor means they are going to have to have **layoffs**. According to several former employees and a current employee working in their office (posting in previous threads), there is serious concern about potential layoffs coming because sponsors are worried about being associated with all the negativity.

So the Fine Bros have a lot on their hands. There will be lawsuits coming to challenge their ridiculous trademark on ""React"". There will be a lot of pissed off people flooding their sponsors' social media pages that may cost them sponsors. And they are dealing with serious office morale loss because of how tainted their ""brand"" is. The Fine Bros built their business on internet culture, they should have really known better than to think they could get away with this.","<div class=""md""><p>Copypasta from the other thread on the frontpage.

Coke was suing for the use in the name, *but* that's a tactic to try to stifle competition.

Ask yourself, what exactly is the ""specific"" structure of a kid's react, teen's react, or elders react video? The structure is just showing people a video and asking some questions. That's the whole react format! That's what they are trying to copyright despite shows like ""I Love The 80's"" doing the exact same thing way before them. There are kids react videos on youtube from at least as far back as 2007.

And notice their PR speak. They are ""allowing"" you to do something. This means there is something that you are NOT allowed to do.

Edit 3: **Even more censorship from the Fine Bros**

The Fine Bros posted a PR response in their comment section trying to claim they weren't copyrighting reaction videos. After getting a lot of backlash 3 hours ago, they deleted and REPOSTED the EXACT SAME comment in order to get rid of all the critical replies they received to their original comment. After about half an hour of leaving this reposted comment up, they started censoring the replies to the comment by hiding all but 3 of the replies. Finally, after getting even more backlash, they DELETED their own comment.

Proof:

After huge backlash, they've actually undeleted their older comment:

<p>And notice their PR speak. They are &quot;allowing&quot; you to do something. This means there is something that you are NOT allowed to do.</p>

<p>Edit 3: <strong>Even more censorship from the Fine Bros</strong></p>

<p>The Fine Bros posted a PR response in their comment section trying to claim they weren&#39;t copyrighting reaction videos. After getting a lot of backlash 3 hours ago, they deleted and REPOSTED the EXACT SAME comment in order to get rid of all the critical replies they received to their original comment. After about half an hour of leaving this reposted comment up, they started censoring the replies to the comment by hiding all but 3 of the replies. Finally, after getting even more backlash, they DELETED their own comment.</p>

<p>Proof:</p>

<p><a href=""http://imgur.com/a/44oFM"">http://imgur.com/a/44oFM</a></p>

<p>After huge backlash, they&#39;ve actually undeleted their older comment:</p>

<p><a href=""http://imgur.com/n1tvWuR"">http://imgur.com/n1tvWuR</a></p>

<p>Notice the HUGE change in the top comments. Now, the top comments are 2 day old comments, instead of what they were just a few minutes ago. They are doing some very major comment manipulations right now. Their twitter is also in full damage control mode. </p>

As i said, I USED to be on one of the React shows, and their contracts, ever since day one when they only had a few million subscribers, have always been incredibly strict and pretty ridiculous, but it was stuff I could live with, the main thing being you couldn't have a youtube channel.

But, unbelievably, their contracts got even crazier and I couldn't believe they actually wanted me to sign it. I basically told them to f*k off, that I wasn't signing my life away, which is what it felt like I wouldve been doing if I had signed it.

Dont get me wrong, i always loved going in to film and working with benny and rafi who were always so nice and cool...........BUT, when it comes to the business side of things, they don't give a shit about anybody but themselves and making a ton of money off of you and giving virtually none of that to you. But they make it seem, like they're doing here, that its all for YOU, and benefits YOU, when it really screws you over. I told everyone they'd be idiots for signing that contract (which I think I was really the only one to actually READ it, and not just blindly sign it), but they all did, and I think most of them are incredibly stupid for doing it.

At first, when I saw they basically wanted to own everything i ever did on the internet and sign my life away, and realized how as much as they said they cared about me, they really didn't especially when they werent willing to change any of the contract when they said theyd work with you on it if you were uncomfortable, and I decided it was not worth it and didn't like how i was being treated so walked away from being on their shows, I was pretty sad and heartbroken, and a little angry and bitter at them too.

But now, after all this coming out, I can say I'm really happy I'm no longer working with them and that I walked away and stood up for myself.

I can tell you no matter what they say and claim, they are ONLY doing this to make more money and take advantage of people and harass them, its not to create ""this ~awesome~ community.

Unfortunately, quite a lot of great discussion was lost in the previous thread because of its removal, so I'll post a recap of what is going on:

The Fine Bros are claiming ""reaction"" videos as their intellectual property. If they succeed, then they can use youtube/google to remove any reaction video they want, much like how unauthorized movies and music videos are currently removed.

They want to do this so that anyone who wants to make reaction videos have to ""license"" their trademark. This is just a money grab. People are already making reaction videos, the Fine Bros just want them to start paying. In exchange, they throw in some nonsense ""resources"" in there to ""help"" you make reaction videos. As if people are currently having trouble recording people watching videos.

And when you do license with them you give up all kinds of rights:

>We’ve trademarked all our shows, which means they are legally protected

>We can revoke the license at any time.

>All brand integrations must run through FBE

>This is a purely digital license. You will not be able to turn the format into TV shows or be paid by third parties to create the content. If you are contacted for brand, distribution, merch or other opportunities related to the licensed format, FBE will take lead in those conversations


Basically, they want to control you and take money from you for making reaction videos, and they're using the power of Youtube/Google to do it. And now they are censoring any discussions about this on their video so that people don't find out. Shame on these two.

Edit: I should also add that reaction videos have existed on youtube since its inception. There are kids reaction videos on there that predate their channel by years. And TV shows from around the world have done the ""reaction"" format for decades. Any national morning news show like Good Morning America will have segments where hosts sit around a couch and watch/react to the latest funny/viral video. This format was not at all original and no one considered it ""stealing"" for using it. But if the Fine Bros want to claim it as copyrighted, then they themselves stole the reaction format from people who have done it before them.

Edit2: Want to get even more angry? Read their blog post on this telling you why you are a criminal for stealing their format for making reaction videos and why you should pay them. They also tell you that it's not enough you pay them, but they want to take full control over how you make money (towards to end of the post).

Notice the very careful language they use to try and make it seem like they are the good guys doing you a favor by helping you stop stealing ""their"" format. And how they are doing something great and noble by copyrighting their reaction format. A format that they didn't invent, that's been used on countless TV shows, that's been on youtube before they even uploaded their first video. Yes, that format now belongs to them, and you are a thief and criminal for stealing it if you make reaction videos. Lovely guys:

They're basically co-opting the focus group concept. Sit people down, have them watch a piece of media, gauge their responses, ask questions, separate into marketing demographics and report the results. 

If they're copyrighting/trademarking their brand and materials I  hardly see anything wrong with it. It seems that they have every right to claim their specific set-up, logos, etc., without totally controlling every video where some asshole videos himself on webcam reacting to the new Star Wars trailer.

 I am also not a lawyer. 

However, as a regular moron consumer, I see two ethical pitfalls here. 

Number one: Are they gaining permission from content creators to feature their videos? If I were to create a viral video that then gained a bajillion views and was featured on their series, would I  receive any compensation? Would they need my permission before they monetized their reaction videos?

My guess is probably not. That seems awful ballsy to claim a copyright based on a product that relies on other content to sustain itself. I'm sure they claim fair use and maybe even that they bring more attention to the video in question by featuring it on their show, thus bringing the original creator more views and revenue, even though I strongly doubt they could prove that correlation. 

And how would they feel if I made a reaction video to one of their reaction videos? Would they be hunky dory with me claiming fair use, on the grounds of parody or criticism? My guess, again, is probably not. 

The second issue I see at hand is: Just how similar to their format does something need to be before youtube will act to take it down?

I tend to find reaction videos kind of stupid anyway (honestly, who cares what YOU think about such and such product that's being marketed...You're playing right into the hands of some corporation by doing their job for them), though I'll sometimes watch a fish out of water playful video. Recent ones that I can think of are the Korean girls trying American BBQ, or watching American porn. 

Those, I think, offer a nice slice of life. What it appears here is that these Fine Bros. guys have serialized this idea to make money off of content they didn't produce.

Since that's the case, just how much of their content can they claim to be original and thus owned by them? They certainly don't own the videos on which they comment. They don't own the test audience concept. And they don't own the act of reacting to things and posting it online. They merely own the right to their format, whatever that may be. 

To where do they see the parameters of that format extending?

There are a lot of questions about this. I'm always dubious of people who claim they want to ""revolutionize"" something. 

Like, other than monopolizing, what could be their reasoning for needing a trademark? Was there some competing service that was ripping them off? If they're claiming innocence and a want to change youtube entertainment for the better, then what prompted this? What are they responding to that they felt the need to better protect their content?

It's all so baffling considering these are the guys crusading for protections for youtube creators, the very guys who exploit other creators with their videos.

2294,True,True,https://api.reddit.com/api/info/,[],"10541 :: The Fine Bros from Youtube are now attempting to copyright ""reaction...",[replies],,,False,LadyKa,,,,"I started reading these Fine Brothers threads with a very moderate and passive attitude. It sounded to me like Fine Brothers Entertainment were simply pitching a business idea to interested Youtubers: ""want your videos to get likes and views? Split your revenue with us and we'll endorse you like so...."" And of course there would be legalities you'd have to follow if you jumped on board. I mean, they're lending their brand and name to you (sorta), so you'd have to produce content that would be a credit to them as well. Maybe it's a good deal, maybe it isn't; I haven't read the contract nor am I personally interested in FBE's offer....but why was everyone so up in arms? It seemed like people such as OP were trying to turn a molehill into a mountain. This announcement only affects people trying to grow YouTube channels, and only a small part of the demographic at that, right?

Then I read more. Here are my concerns as an everyday, internet-using citizen. One that does NOT have a YouTube channel, in fact.

I want to preface this by making a general statement: YouTube is where you go to post videos. I've never put a video on the internet, but if I wanted to, I'd put it up on YouTube. That's the platform on which I personally watch 99% of videos as well as the only one that I as an average Joe slightly understand operations-wise. I think my general situation is the same as a LOT of other redditors, and I think that this (my) demographic has a need to be concerned about what's going on here. FBE may be taking a stand on video trademark or copyright law that affects us too. Us YouTube consumers that may someday want to be casual content producers, knowing little to nothing about that law. Or us consumers that support and subscribe to certain channels who might be affected by this.

Plus this whole debate makes for some pretty good reading. So here are an average person's concerns:

1. FBE has the right to regulate legally videos (either by promotion or censorship) that contain what we lay-people would understand as their original content. I take 'original content' to be things like theme music, graphics or a specific layout that their company created specifically for the FB videos, which runs throughout their series. Fine. Good. They wouldn't be much of a business if they didn't protect that stuff, and I don't see anyone disagreeing. So why the censorship of MULTIPLE channels who use none of this content? Numerous examples have been listed before me as reference. I'm not pretending I don't see a similarity, but what I notice is a similarity of subject matter, not original content. And a laughably vague similarity at that: ""people see/hear something new or surprising. People have differing thoughts and feelings about it."" That's not an original idea, that's the human condition. You and I should be concerned about this because I bet a lot of your home videos center around relatives reacting to holidays, birthdays, surprises or shocks. If the Fine Brothers have a monopoly on showing this kind of thing, say goodbye to your dream of sharing that video where you told the kids you were going to Disneyland.

2. They're trademarking words and phrases. Since trademarking relates to brand identification, FBE is claiming that ""kids react"", ""teens react"" and ""elders react"" is their brand. Okayyyy....so that just means that you and I would have to be a little more clever in titling and describing our videos, right? Put ""My children react to the news of a Disneyland trip"" instead of ""Kids react to news of Disneyland trip"". That's annoying but workable. Personally I think they need to attach ""FB"" or ""FBE"" if it's brand recognition they're after. It's just those three phrases which are no-nos so far, but what about the pending trademark on ""react""? Guys, that's not a description or a flimsy vague title at best, that's a VERB. As in an action. An action people had been performing long before FB came about, and will be performing long after they're gone. We've been watching and recording in some form or another people's reactions to things ever since the practical joke was born. So this just plain doesn't make sense. How do you claim rights over this? Our concern here is that in using common words and phrases to title or describe our videos, we may be inviting legal trouble.

3. FBE is big. I mean seriously HUGE. They have employees and sponsors who dedicate workforces to upholding FBE's creative property. They have both in the past and are currently censoring YouTube channels and videos where some demographic they wish to trademark is reacting to something. Even little bitty channels like you and I might create. There are actually two concerns here:

A. Average guys you and I are now supposed to automatically know which common phrases and words (again-verbs? Really?) are forbidden. God help us if others start following suit.

B. If we are targeted for strikes, it's up to the accused to bring the burden of proof if we want our videos reinstated. Even if the strikes are blatant mistakes (like getting taken down for using ""react"" in a manner completely unrelated to human beings), do I have the time, energy, or maybe even money to pursue this? Do you? Most of us would probably just let it go, and a little bit more creativity and enjoyment will vanish from YouTube.

4. The last point I want to make concerns FBE asserting their trademark ""rights"" in arenas they completely don't belong to. The Fine Brothers brand exists as VIDEOS. On the INTERNET. A clearly defined medium and platform. Yet they've made tentative shoves at chastising other forms of media/entertainment. See posters above for information about them shaking their heads at the Ellen show for a segment she aired. This is alarming! Could they have a legal foothold in stopping other forms of popular entertainment or media from using this vague ""brand"" they're trying so hard to monopolize? What if I'm a radio dj who plays an old song and asks people to call in and comment on it? Does this affect me? Even if not legally, FB are certainly vocal about getting their large fan base to publicly disapprove! I could be slandered by a huge population for a supposed trademark violation stemming from nothing but two guys' lofty ideas about what makes ""original content"". 

In summary, what I would like to see is this: public clarification from the Fine Brothers. Tell the world explicitly what you'll be censoring them for. Is it just the use of those lyrics, or music, or graphics you guys made for your channel? Great! Then let us know and all of my concerns are totally unfounded. Is it only the use of those trademarked words and phrases? Dickish, but at least we know where we stand in terms of content. Or is it the actual physical video recording of human emotions that you're trying to monopolize? We need a clear picture here. At least TRY. Your ambiguity is starting to look more and more sinister in the eyes of a LOT of people. Do both us and yourselves and favor and give clear yes and no answers on what you're specifically going to attack, and what you're gain to leave alone.  ","<div class=""md""><p>I started reading these Fine Brothers threads with a very moderate and passive attitude. It sounded to me like Fine Brothers Entertainment were simply pitching a business idea to interested Youtubers: &quot;want your videos to get likes and views? Split your revenue with us and we&#39;ll endorse you like so....&quot; And of course there would be legalities you&#39;d have to follow if you jumped on board. I mean, they&#39;re lending their brand and name to you (sorta), so you&#39;d have to produce content that would be a credit to them as well. Maybe it&#39;s a good deal, maybe it isn&#39;t; I haven&#39;t read the contract nor am I personally interested in FBE&#39;s offer....but why was everyone so up in arms? It seemed like people such as OP were trying to turn a molehill into a mountain. This announcement only affects people trying to grow YouTube channels, and only a small part of the demographic at that, right?</p>

<p>Then I read more. Here are my concerns as an everyday, internet-using citizen. One that does NOT have a YouTube channel, in fact.</p>

<p>I want to preface this by making a general statement: YouTube is where you go to post videos. I&#39;ve never put a video on the internet, but if I wanted to, I&#39;d put it up on YouTube. That&#39;s the platform on which I personally watch 99% of videos as well as the only one that I as an average Joe slightly understand operations-wise. I think my general situation is the same as a LOT of other redditors, and I think that this (my) demographic has a need to be concerned about what&#39;s going on here. FBE may be taking a stand on video trademark or copyright law that affects us too. Us YouTube consumers that may someday want to be casual content producers, knowing little to nothing about that law. Or us consumers that support and subscribe to certain channels who might be affected by this.</p>

<p>Plus this whole debate makes for some pretty good reading. So here are an average person&#39;s concerns:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>FBE has the right to regulate legally videos (either by promotion or censorship) that contain what we lay-people would understand as their original content. I take &#39;original content&#39; to be things like theme music, graphics or a specific layout that their company created specifically for the FB videos, which runs throughout their series. Fine. Good. They wouldn&#39;t be much of a business if they didn&#39;t protect that stuff, and I don&#39;t see anyone disagreeing. So why the censorship of MULTIPLE channels who use none of this content? Numerous examples have been listed before me as reference. I&#39;m not pretending I don&#39;t see a similarity, but what I notice is a similarity of subject matter, not original content. And a laughably vague similarity at that: &quot;people see/hear something new or surprising. People have differing thoughts and feelings about it.&quot; That&#39;s not an original idea, that&#39;s the human condition. You and I should be concerned about this because I bet a lot of your home videos center around relatives reacting to holidays, birthdays, surprises or shocks.

I also hate it when, if a YouTuber is funny in a natural setting (i.e. chatting/playing games/discussing events alone or with their friends on camera,) they get it into their heads that they're a 'comedian' and start promoting themselves as such without doing any of the work that actual comedians do. As a huge comedy nerd, I think there's a big difference between being a naturally funny person and comedy. Example; The Hodge Twins. Now I love them because of....*reasons* (I'm only human!) but I noticed recently that they're doing 'live shows' now. I just don't understand how that's going to work. Is it like a full stand-up show? Have they written and road tested actual jokes? What they do is great for 3-5 minute YouTube videos but I don't see it translating to a stage show. Are the entire audience just going to be pervs like me? It just smacks of a poorly conceived money grab.","<div class=""md""><p>captainsparklez is a perfect example.

I'll quote here the answer from David Mullich:

> Possibly. A claim for copyright infringement requires proof of two elements: that the plaintiff owns a copyright, and that the defendant copied original elements of the plaintiff’s copyrighted work. To prove infringement, a plaintiff must prove access and substantial similarity between the works at issue.  This protection is what prevents reality show television producers from making shows with the identical format to such franchise shows as Survivor, American Idol or Big Brother, with the only differences being, say, the title of the show, details of the set design, and the people who are the hosts or judges.

> Now, if your channel contains too many similarities to the Fine Brothers' channel, you could be at risk of copyright infringement.  It would be up to a judge to determine whether your channel is similar enough to the other channel to constitute copyright infringement, should the Fine Brothers decide to take you to court.

> However, there are exceptions to franchise protection.

> If the basic idea of the franchise can only be expressed in a limited number of ways, then the expression itself will not be protected, except possibly against identical copying, as allowing that would give a virtual monopoly to the first person expressing the idea.  I've never watched the React shows, so I don't know how many different ways there is to do a show like theirs.

> There is also the exception of scènes à faire, where the elements of a work are used by so many other similar works that they are considered stock elements.  An example in mystery stories would be the ending where the detective gathers all the suspects and eliminates them one-by-one; such a scene might have originated in an Agathy Christie novel, but such scenes are now so commonly found in other mystery novels that you are free to use a similar scene in your own novel.

From the looks of it, the current situation would fall under the first exception. There is a very, very limited number of ways to build a ""React"" video. You show people whatever you wanna show them, record their reactions, and then you either ask questions or don't. I can't think of any other way to express a React video, since it's so straightforward.

Now the real question is: What exactly constitutes the ""format"" that they are claiming copyright on? Is it as broad as recording people's reactions and then asking questions? Or is it specific as cutting away from person to person, showing relevant facts on the bottom of the screen, etc...?

They seem to be licensing their brands and not reaction videos as a whole. I don't see how this will really affect other youtube reactors. It's like they are franchising their channels for other people while they do all the corporate branding, promo, etc. Knowing how Youtube networks actually function it will probably not be a good deal thou.

Individual productions of those shows are copyrighted.  So Episode 1, Season 1 of Got Talent or whatever has copyright protection.

The talent show format is not copyright protected.

A specific element of the show, like the one with the spinning chair lets say, could be registered as a trademark, something that is exclusively associated to that specific production.  

The name, also, could be protected with a mark.

But the way they describe it in the video makes it seem like they are franchising the ""reaction"" style video generally. 

Certainly they can sell graphics, video packages, production help etc however they want, but I can't see their angle in protecting the concept of a reaction video as a general thing.  Certainly some element or elements could be trademarked, and even maybe the topic lists or whatever could be copy protected (although generally lists of things can't be copyrighted).

That's why it's a weird business model.  There is no intellectual property protection that would prevent me from offering a competing service with my own branding but otherwise nearly identical.

So if some guy uploads a video of his kids watching a sad scene in a movie and titles it ""Kids react to Gerry the Dinosaur dying!"" and it goes viral, the Fine Bro's could then ask google to remove it via their automated system, ""Kids React is our copyright/trademark/brand!""

Likewise, lets say there's a marginally popular channel that regularly produces React-style videos and has been doing it well before Finebro's began doing it or before they became popular for doing it, the Finebro's would now be able to essentially stamp out any sort of competition he might have presented despite the fact that he's just a medium-sized channel with a modest viewer base and has been doing react videos for much longer than the Finebro's. Youtube only cares that a close partner and apparent copyright holder requests that his videos get removed due to copyright violation.

Then there's a section where they reveal info about the clip the reactors might not know. More questions. Etc.

It's a specific sequence of clips. It's a FORMAT which is the most important thing next to the idea.

So these guys are offering to share with you their format and give you guildelines that they probably use themselves to make videos that are consistent. And also you get to associate with their successful brand. 

This is basically like a franchise. You could open your own pizza delivery place. Nobody would sue you. Or you can open a Domino's franchise where they tell you how to do everything and basically you just have to do the work.

And you take part in this ONLY IF YOU CHOSE TO.

They are not copyrighting ""a video where people react."" They are copyrighting their FORMAT.

**This is exactly like a country wanting to do their version of ""BLANK'S GOT TALENT"" like America's Got Talent and Britain's Got Talent. So what do they do? They get a license to make their own version of the show. They are told what the format is, given graphics, fonts, music, everything they need to make their own version. And in return, they give some of the money to the people who own the FORMAT FOR THE SHOW.**

Very misleading title. No, they are in fact NOT trying to copyright ""reaction videos"". They're trying to protect their very specific format on how they do the show and open it up for others to use. I mean literally, copying their branding/backgrounds/scripts etc.

It's already illegal to copy their react format, the only thing that's changing is that if you *want* to (which currently nobody has), you can now share revenue with them. **Literally no one making react videos previously, now, or in the future will be affected by this change.**

It's the same reason why you can't copy every element of the price is right, and just change the name of it to call it your own. You can't copy someone's format and call it your own, this is not new.

Your title is extremely misleading, as well as just being incorrect.

Their format isn't ""watch a thing, and then talk about it"" so much as it's the overlays and layout.

Please read it if you have the chance.

And watch the video starting here:

https://youtu.be/r2UqT6SZ7CU?t=2m3s

They are extremely careful about their language to make it seem like they are doing the exact opposite of what they are doing. They want to make it seem like they are encouraging content but they really just want to siphon off money from content creators by claiming that they OWN the very format of ""reaction"". They are saying that kids react, teens react, and all other reacts are THEIR format and that you need to buy a license from them to do it legally. If you do not, you are STEALING their format/intellectual property.

They are complaining that their format is being ""blatantly stolen by companies and people..."".

From their blog they said this:

>It’s still too easy to steal other’s ideas, and creator rights are being trampled.

>We’re now experiencing a shift back to old competitive behaviors where media creators will pile on to what they see as successful in order to make money themselves. Unfortunately, the industry best practices, the platform rules and features, and the global courts have not kept pace with this change and there are no real consequences for violating intellectual property, stealing ideas, concepts, and ripping off formats.

>This is happening everywhere, from mega companies like Buzzfeed constantly ripping off other show concepts and formats; to individuals who are trying to piggyback off the success of other creator’s formats [NOTE: REACT FORMAT]

>If you know anything about us, you know we don’t tend to keep our opinions to ourselves, and have been vocal directly with YouTube, the industry and others about the need to continually evolve practices and **protections**.

>When you look at traditional media, you see that formats ripoffs have been a huge problem in the past. Producers and media companies will see that a certain format or story has gotten breakout success, and will copycat it as much as they can.

So watch this video and read the blog. Ask yourself, what format are they licensing and claiming as their ""intellectual property""? Why do they think other people are stealing their format/intellectual property? And what are they doing about it?

Well, they use very very selective language to conceal their true motive. They keep trying to make it sound like what they're doing is SUPPORTING the people already making reaction videos. But what they really want is to lock up the ""reaction format"" and LICENSE it to ""ANYONE"" who wants to make these videos. The problem is, people, ANYONE, can already make these videos. But they don't currently pay the Fine Bros. That's what this video and initiative is really trying to change. To have other people pay the Fine Bros.

And let's see, right now, everyone on youtube making reaction videos are doing it happily right now. They have full control over their content. But what will this initiative change? Let's read their own words:

>**We’ve trademarked all our shows, which means they are legally protected**

>We can revoke the license at any time.

>All brand integrations must run through FBE 

>This is a purely digital license. You will not be able to turn the format into TV shows or be paid by third parties to create the content. If you are contacted for brand, distribution, merch or other opportunities related to the licensed format, FBE will take lead in those conversations

Don't forget that once something is recognized as ""trademarked/legally protected"", they don't need to take you to court, they can just get Google/Youtube to take down your videos at their request. Try uploading Star Wars TFA on youtube and see how long it lasts. Well, Mutlichannel networks on youtube has long had the same power. They have gained ""recognition"" from youtube and can take down channels that uses any of its IP at will. That's why people had such a hard to criticizing prank channels in the past few weeks, because those prank channels belong to huge networks that strike down videos for BS reasons. Well, if the Fine Bros succeed, they will gain the same power. They claim react formats are theirs, so they can take down people stealing their format. It's bullshit, this is a total money grab. If they ONLY offered a service to help others make videos, then what they say about encouraging content would be true.

You can't have a brand name that is already a commonly used phrase or a generic description. Thermos, escalator, heroin, kerosene, mimeograph, trampoline, and even videotape were all once trademarked brands. The owners of brands such as Kleenex, LEGO, Frisbee, Google, and others are very much aware of this and actively fight the generization of these words by specifying that they are ""Kleenex facial tissues"", ""LEGO toy building bricks"", ""Google search engine"", etc. The problem is that in this instance, the phrase has already been genericized before someone (the Fine Bros) is trying to trademark it. It's equivalent to a furniture company trying to trademark the word ""chair"".

So they can't trademark/copy-write the format, duh. But what they do ""own"" is kids react, teens react, adults react, elders react,  ect. So those are all four major age groups that could be represented and trademarked are.

Ok so they have 4 out of 4 age brackets. Once they have those done what stops them from obtaining more IP and just claiming it's a minor derivative of their work? You can't have ""elementary students"" react, nor can you have ""south-western retiree's from Florida"" react. Now what falls under their umbrella of ownership? What else can they grab? If they suddenly decide to do Koreans react even though it already exists, could they claim it still because they're technically teens/adults? Would they have a case? Would youtube care since TheFineBros get more views and more money and could handle a lawsuit better than smaller companies?

Let's use a parallel example:

Coke. Someone had made soda before so they can't own ""soda"". However coke has a formula that can be defined and trademarked. Now they own cherry coke, but let's say that they won the trademark for and now own ""cherry flavored soda"". Now, no soda company can make cherry flavored soda. Now coke has other flavors including, Cola, vanilla, orange, ect, ect that they trademark as well. Then they get/have so much clout and money they can pretty much run over everyone else no problem. 

Now those examples may/may not hold up in court, but here's the rub: youtube will take down any videos TheFineBros wants. Denying revenue and attention, and giving more money to theFineBros to handle anyone that would sue them in meat court. This is where it's a problem.

There are no upfront costs when you license from us. When you join React World you enter into a revenue share agreement based on actual revenue generated by your videos. There are two kinds of revenue, that which is generally YouTube adsense, and the other is more premium brand deals. If you connect your channel to React World on Youtube, your split is 80% of adsense and 70% of premium brand deals. If you are independent on YouTube or in an MCN, the split is 60% of adsense and 50% of premium brand deals.

- Reddit is only letting us reply one post every 10 minutes not sure why, trying to fix, will reply here and there. Sorry for the confusion.  Due to this, we have been answering questions over there. And will try to get to people over there as we can. 

Benny & Rafi Fine here to clear the confusion and answer your questions - please reply to this thread and we will be answering throughout the day. Please see below to clarify what React World is. 

1: We do not hold a copyright on reaction videos overall. No one can. It isn’t something you can copyright.

2: We are not going after/shutting down/sueing anyone who makes reaction based content. We are licensing our specific shows and their structural elements. 

3: On the confusion around what we mean by our “format” we do NOT mean “people reacting to videos” we mean the structural elements of the FBE series.  Most series have protectable elements, which is why you see multiple shows across entertainment that have the same idea, but a different presentation.  The FBE series (Such as “Kids React”, “Lyric Breakdown”, & “Do They Know It?"" also have trademarks in terms of their title, and elements like their title cards, timing, graphical elements, etc. which is what you are licensing in terms of what we mean by “format”. 

4: We don’t like to make parallels to TV but think of it like this.  You have a TV network in another country and want to make a singing show.  You can make a brand new format on your own and come up with every aspect of that series and hope it works out (and it might do great) or you can pay to license an established brand (like an “American Idol”) and make a your version which could increase your chances of success as well as give you the tools to produce the series efficiently.  

To us, this is a way to connect with our viewers and allow people to make their own version of a show they love to watch. Again we’ll be replying in this thread if there are further questions.

You liars.

You posted this two days ago, and the last 48 hours, the front page has been speckled with report after report of small YouTube content creators getting hit by your company. You are totally going after people, you have algorithms scouring YouTube looking for anything with ""react"" in the title and indiscriminately taking it down.

You know what doesn't lie? Numbers. http://socialblade.com/youtube/user/thefinebros/realtime

The real-time tracking of your subscriber count has been catostrophic. You have gone from +8000 a day to -11000, a difference of -19000. If our words don't convince you, then math should. This was a bad decision and we're not falling for your ""community-driven"" mental gymnastics.

>it's our own show in structure and on its own has no likelihood of confusion to other content.

You have got to be kidding. This wasn't your idea. You aren't the first. You don't ""own"" this format, and any sensible copyright judge will see to it that you never do.

Liars. Liars and fakes. All of you liars and fakes.

When this broke, I was just hoping you would immediately reverse your decision and apologize. I would've been quick to forgive, because of course companies are prone to not think things through and maybe we all were just being overly paranoid over the trademark claim. But all the hate you're getting, all the distrust and paranoia of people who called you out?

Turns out they didn't need to prove anything. With your blatantly aggressive actions, fully contradictory to your pro-content creator sentiment, you justified every bit of it.

The various takedowns over the last couple days proves you are committed to targeting small content creators. So the opportunity to make a tactical retreat and apologize has passed. That ship is sailed. All I hope now is the unceremonious and embarrassing end to the Fine Bros. I hope you guys straight up fail and end up penniless street beggars with nothing but disgrace and shame to your name. I hope you live the rest of your pitiful existence with the knowledge of what universally reviled greedy hacks you are. I hope you disappear from relevance, remembered only as another Icarus figure who flew too close to the sun, and burned up in their own hubris.","<div class=""md""><blockquote>

If that is the case, I remember seeing a post from the two of you on Facebook putting Ellen Degeneres on blast because she was supposedly ripping off your react concept when she was getting these two kids to try out some old technology. If I recall, you told your fans to go to Ellen's page and tell her about you two. And while some of your fans agreed, there were those who criticized, thinking you have overreacted. Ellen didn't blatantly rip your series off, she just did a segment with a theme that has been done a thousand times over.

Unfortunately I can't find the post, most likely having been deleted.

I get it that you want to protect the format of your series and all. If anyone makes an obvious copycat of your show and make it look identical right down to the last detail, then a line has been crossed. But in the creative world especially, basic ideas have already been done. There are no original ideas anymore but what can we do with the basics that would make our ideas stand out?

So it seems like ""X reacts to Y"" is indeed the title format they are trying to trademark.  I did some basic Googling on intellectual property, and one of the oldest exceptions to trademarks is ""descriptive words and phrases""; the book that I saw on Amazon that mentioned this cited some examples e.g. a company was able to trademark the phrase ""Camel leather belt"" (or something similar) because even though the phrase was describing a product using generic words, they had been the *only* company associated with that product for 10+ years and could say it was exclusively associated with their brand.  Conversely, it mentioned that a similar attempt to trademark ""Chicago style pizza"" failed because there were numerous companies that had made a product that they had described in those terms.  

Have the Fine Brothers been the *only* creators associated with the term ""X reacts to Y"" for so long that no reasonable person could term that phrase a ""generic description""?  Since the only reaction videos I've remembered liking on YouTube were NOT made by them, and reaction videos predated their arrival to YouTube, I'd say no, and I'd hope that YouTube would agree.

Yes, this scenario is entirely possible and likely.  However, there may be an innocuous reason why it occurs and there is an easy and cheap first response for the young newtuber.  

1. FBE is required to protect its brand if it wants to claim ownership, even if it deep down FBE doesn't care about what young youtuber is doing.  This is because the law requires an owner to actively police and protect its brands.  There was a case regarding a famous artist or photographer (I think it was Ansel Adams) who never bothered to go after publishers that printed and sold their works without paying royalties.  Years later the artist's family began suing the worst perpetrators and the court ruled in favor of the perps b/c the owner had never bothered to pursue them.  It was a rational similar to imminent domain whereby a squatter can earn ownership of land by living on it openly for a period of time.  Thus, anytime FBE learns of a youtuber making video that seems similar to its brand, its legal team will likely send out such a letter to prove that FBE intends to protect its brand. FBE may not actually want the young youtuber to do anything or pay anything and may not even pursue the subject further.  
2. The young youtuber presumably wants to earn recognition and perhaps money for their posted content.  Thus, they need to police and protect their video.  If they believe their video is different enough from FBE to call BS on the cease and desist letter, they should write FBE's registered agent a response on paper, print it out, sign their name, and mail it using Certified Mail with a Return Receipt Requested.  You can find form responses to cease and desist letters on any reputable consumer group website or state attorney general's website.  You must MAIL it with certified mail and a return receipt requested to show FBE that you understand the law and are putting your answer down on paper, not a virtual response.  This has important legal distinctions and will only cost the young youtuber $7.00 at a local post office.  Heck, some states even allow you to send it using UPS or FedEx, but email NEVER counts.  NEVER.  NEVER EVER.  NEVER EVER EVER.  (Sorry, part of my work is in consumer law and this point fucks my clients over more than any other.)
3. Lastly, a young youtuber that is savvy enough to create a reaction video and post it to youtube, is likely savvy enough to throw together a crap font logo and stick at the start of the tape.  This would be further proof that young youtuber never intended for their content to be confused with others'. 
4.  You'd be amazed how much Step #2 puts an end to this shit.  Combine it with Step #3 and you've got a pretty solid situation for the young youtuber.
